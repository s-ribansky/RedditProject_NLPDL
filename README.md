# RedditProject_NLPDL
This GitHub repository contains the documentation for a NLP Deep Learning project carried out at the Hertie School of Governance in Berlin.

For the moment, there are three files: i) the code, which is a minimal code from another GitHub repo, cited in the paper, ii) the paper describing the authors' motivation, and iii) the short databse used for the initial model runs obtained from Kaggle. THe link to  the full databes is provided in the paper. 

We are grateful for any and all feedback that can help us improve the performance of the model on Reddit data.
