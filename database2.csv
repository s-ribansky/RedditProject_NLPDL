"Because we aren't responsible for the actions of our forebears?

We should help these people not because of some race karma but because of love for your common man. 

And we've tried. We give them advantages by giving them things like affirmative action, diversity quotas and scholarships that white people (even ones as poor or poorer) don't get. They don't want change. 

The black community has lashed out against a problem for which even they don't have a solution. 

What do they want from us? To abolish police and law? To remove punishments for black crime and release black criminals? To force white people to not leave a neighborhood when black people start moving in (and as a measurable consequence, an increase in crime)? 

The cause of their problems lie in two places: 

The actions of a misguided ""community"" in which individuals use race as an excuse to commit more crime

And individual prejudice inside of every day people who collectively make life harder for them. 

The former of the the two possibly being a consequence of the latter but I digress. The second one won't be fixed with violent riots and crime. It only makes more racists. And the only way you could forcibly change that would be with an Orwellian Thought Police system which is immoral on the deepest level. 

How do you change the mind of the individual? I'm not completely sure. Nobody really is. If black rioters/criminals started taking responsibility for their actions, made an effort to improve relations with the common man and stopped glorifying thuggish and criminal activity, white people would take notice and shift even further from their subconscious racist tendencies. 

Because when something is so baked in to your consciousness, being a person isn't enough to earn a chance to not be hated, you need to give people a reason to not be racist towards you. (and I'm not saying this is how it should be, it's just how it is) ",1

There is also many intelligence service players in area. It is easiest to create a large conflict with the false flag terrorist attacks on both sides and encourage the cycle of revenge.,1

**Boss required me to sign a document waiving my right take a lunch/breaks. Help /r/legaladvice!**

&gt; I work in the food service industry in Seattle, and have been with my current company for about 5 years. Back in December, every member of our customer service staff (it's a small corporate chain, less than 200 employees) was required to sign [this document](http://imgur.com/iwa6IEQ), or else have all of our shifts cut to 4 hours each in length or less.  I work for minimum wage, and have never been offered or granted a raise by this company when I've asked.  I'm not passionate about my currently line of work, but my personal sense of justice feels violated to the point of needing to put my foot down.
&gt; 
&gt; I know what you're thinking: ""Get a new job!"" And yes, I'm in the process of looking for another job using other skills. A few of my coworkers are like family to me.  While I might be able to leave the situation, they aren't as fortunate, and that frustration bugs me to no end. The management at this company has stepped over the line of reason, and I'm not sure what legal recourse to utilize, or where to start.
&gt; 
&gt; -I know that their encouraging me to sign this document is illegal.
&gt; -I also know that I would lose my job if my employer read this post (as such, I've removed the header from the document)
&gt; 
&gt; What do I do /r/legaladvice!?  Halp!",1

Btw, you likely didn't fail him. It's very normal for pits to have prey drive and it's very normal for pits to ""turn on"" around his age. Turning on in pit bulls is becoming dog aggressive. 

My little bitch was at the dog park for 2-3 fucking hours, every single day, without fail from the day after her shots were done to about 9 months old. I took her to classes, I took her to stores, I took her everywhere. Didn't matter, little hot girl turned on at 9ish months and we had to stop dog park. She still has dog friends, but they're from her puppy stage and have established relationships. She gets on good with plenty of new dogs, but the 2% she wants to attack plus the 100% that she would never back down from and welcome a fight from meant no more dog park for the most part. 

You need to make sure that these boys are extremely clear on the fact that she's got extremely strong prey drive and also dog aggression. They need to verbally confirm that they understand that they cannot own another dog or pet while he's still alive with them. 

I think the fact you could go visit and also babysit is pretty cool. It's a unique opportunity that lessens the hurt of this decision. 

Lastly, I hate to judge you on appearances, but you seem like the kind of girl who's priorities in life are your social and night life. This is probably just about the worst breed to own for someone like that.

:  a hatred of women 

Nothing about what any of them said implied any sort of hatred of women, at all.  Rodney and Dan's statements were totally sexist, but absolutely not misogynistic.  Nothing about what Will has said strikes me as either sexist or misogynistic, as far as I can tell.

"Another perspective here: it sounds like you're into filmmaking already. My friends are as well (I'm also a writer). Here's my advice.

Move to Los Angeles. Volunteer for indie projects. Network. Give up gaming for reading screenplays. Collaborate. Produce something. Keep producing.

The friends I have that are in guilds spend nearly every waking hour living and breathing movies, and they don't make much money at all. They do have hobbies (such as comics), but they fall by the wayside. Their hobbies seem to become watching movies. Making movies has become their hobby. If you can't give up gaming, then you're probably not that serious about it. Remember, you can always come back to your hobbies if things don't work out.

Like you said, Breaking Bad was rejected by several networks, and Vince was an established writer. There really aren't that many screen writers in Hollywood, so it's a tough proposition. Vince gave the best advice I can think of; you need persistence, but you also need talent and luck. Hone your craft, write a large stack of screenplays, and then decide if its for you.

It's also a low bar measure (""The film can't even pass this basic test"")

"I had a teacher tell me I would ""fail at life,"" that I was ""a detestable little shit"" and some other legitimately upsetting shit because I didn't enjoy the book we were reading (well, to be fair, I was kind of a little shit as well, but it was uncalled for). I left class and went to the park to read in the sun, and came back for my next class.

The vice-principal was this wannabe hardass who had buzzed his hair and bleached it, which gave him the weird appearance of Eminem wearing a suit. He sneaks up behind me as I'm walking down the hall and bellows ""Going somewhere?"" before dragging me down to his office.

He sits me down in his chair and starts this whole intimidation routine, telling me that I have potentially ruined my entire high school career (I'm in grade 9 at this point, by the way), that I'm probably going to be expelled and have to go to a reformatory school, and then he starts interrogating me on my drug use and family situation; basically just going bizarrely over the line considering all I did was skip class.

I told him what she said and he didn't back off; started saying shit like ""I'm sure you misinterpreted that, there's no way she said that, did anybody hear her say that?"" When I told him that the entire class of around 30 kids had heard it, his face turned white and he just told me to go to my next class.

That teacher didn't look me in the eye for the rest of the year, never asked me a single question and didn't do anything regarding my piss-poor attendance. I passed the class with a 65 or 70, though I definitely should have failed.

In all honesty, from that point on, I was more interested in manipulating the teachers that treated me like shit instead of actually putting effort into their classes. I scraped by several of my classes with a 51% using blackmail after they snapped and said something shitty about me.

I dropped out of standard high school in grade 12 and went to an alternative school to finish up. When I got my university acceptance letters, I definitely went back to my old high school - both to thank the teachers who believed in me and helped me, and to show the teachers who acted like dicks to me how wrong they were about me. It might seem petty, but it felt pretty good telling that bitch who told me I would fail at life that I absolutely wouldn't. I also called her a sallow, reptilian bitch before leaving.

Okay, maybe I was a detestable little shit, but she could have been nicer about it.",1

is the police force in baltimore a little corrupt? absolutely. are people profiled and arrested on a daily basis? once again, yes and its a pattern that needs to end if we can hope to fix poverty.

but i think these riots are only happening now because its coming after a mound of similar cases popping up in the news. and people saw ferguson as a very eye opening moment and are choosing to act similarly. the difference is baltimore is not a small, somewhat removed community. its a very large, very diverse city and a lot more people stand to get hurt or have their property destroyed.

"&gt;They raise health insurance rates for one

[So do runners.](http://health.usnews.com/health-news/blogs/on-fitness/2008/08/22/runners-listen-to-your-knees) I know quite a few people who are on their second or third knees at only 50 years old. That isn't even getting into the costs of multiple concussions sustained by many young teenagers from playing sports.

&gt;then you have people taking up two seats on the bus because they have the mass of two people.

Then make them pay for two seats. [Most airlines do this already.](http://www.smartertravel.com/travel-advice/some-airlines-may-make-obese-passengers-buy-two-seats.html?id=2644439) I've sat next to tall people on airlines before and there isn't much room for me at all. Certainly about as much as most people who are obese.

&gt;Then you got doctors rushing obese people to the vet office to use the horse cat scan machine so you have to weight in order for your sick horse to use it.

Could you back this up with a source? I've honestly never heard of it, and if it's true it sounds like something that affects less than 5% of the obese population. Most fat people are not 500+ pounds, in fact only [5% of the population](http://www.lahey.org/Departments_and_Locations/Departments/Medical_and_Surgical_Weight_Loss_Center/Obesity_Demographics.aspx) accounts for morbidly obese people. That means the majority of people who are fat are less than 250 pounds for the average height.

&gt;They stink more than normal, they move slow,

That is definitely true, although I can't really say I've ever went around smelling people. In fact I can't remember the last time I smelled someone else unless I was sitting right next to them. Everyone walks slowly. It's annoying, which is why I walk past them.

&gt;they order so much food at a fast food line that you might as well come back in 10 minutes

Sounds like the people making food need to be fired then. It's not particularly fast food if one persons order takes ten minutes. I've seen five high school football players order food and get it faster. Now if you're saying that one fat man eats more than five bulking hungry teenagers after a long game, then that person doesn't raise insurance rates on account of being dead.

Another reason may be [b/c of dragnet surveillance as is being done in Chicago and over other metropolitan cities](http://www.pbs.org/newshour/rundown/planes-mimic-cellphone-towers-collect-data/), basically the region the pilot flies over gets all its' data usurped, stored and digested.

Therefore, we are taking black money without giving anything back (i.e. jobs).

I have to say that I do understand their point of view when it comes to this. After the L.A. riots, a lot of Korean business owners actually realized this and started making changes. They started hiring more people of the community they were opening up shop in.

Bethesda got their acceptable amount of money from the vanilla game + dlcs that they worked on.  They do nothing to work on the mod and do nothing to maintain compatibility over time.  Valve (I'm not sure about Bethesda too) basically said ""sucks for you"" if an update came along and the mods were incompatible.

I also forgot to mention the part about how both did nothing about the theives who ripped mods off of Nexus and sold them on Steam.

I also doubt that the distribution platform is really so hard to make to justify a minimum of 30% of all sales going to Valve.

edit.  The mods are also basically the #1 reason to buy Skyrim since Bethesda releases incomplete games and counts on modders to finish it for them.",1

"First of all, trp is not ""men"". Trp is a very small subset of men.

Second, trp claims that its a safe haven for men who are upset with the state of women. But I what I see in the trp forum is both new and old members of trp saying the worst things about women and no one corrects them. No one is leading the battalion. 

If you wandered into a forum of all women and saw things like this (that went unchallenged), what would you think? I have seen the male versions of the things below in trp, and I'm going to phrase them as though a woman is saying them from her perspective:

**""Powering through LMR is a thing.""** (The female version)

*Men don't really know what they want. If he has last-minute resistance to say, having sex without a condom when he knows you're not on any contraceptives (and you really want a baby), you just have to apply techniques to loosen his resistance.*




**""Sexual strategy being amoral means that morals don't apply to dating/relationships/sex.""** (The female version)

*Sexual strategy is amoral. You shouldn't rape a guy or get physically violent but everything else is open slather. I'm plating four chumps right now. They all think I'm exclusive to them. It's okay to tell a guy you're interested in a relationship with him and then just hump him and dump him. It's okay to ask for expensive jewellery and trips away while you know you really think he's a chump and won't be staying with him very long. All single women should do it. It makes you feel more like a woman because you get all that male attention and you get gifts too! When it comes time to husband-up a guy, ladies (a hot, worthy guy - not one of your plate chumps), then don't breathe a word of your past. Make it sound like you've only have two LTRs. Make sure you used a fake name and ID with all your previous chumps.*


**""Red pillers refuse to leave women alone.""**

???

**""Red pillers feel entitled to sex.""** (The female version)

*Men who jump on the vagina carousel are disgusting slut-boys. Who wants their used-up, mangled penises? I want a man who is able to keep it in his pants. I want a man with the best possible sperm to have children with - not that mutation-infested over-30 junk sperm. All the best looking men are going for the hot women. Here's some evo psych studies on it. Sexually-hypergamous men is what we women have to deal with. Let's have a mutual rage session. It's why I can't find a decent, hot guy to date. Because they're all after the hot women. Ok, girls, let's go out and get the best plastic surgery there is and trick men into thinking we're hot. Men hate our group because we're trying to trick them. They'll only realize we were actually ugly all along when they have our ugly babies.*

**""Red pillers attempt to control women.""** (The female version)

*All men are children and need to be led by women. We need to make the important decisions for them. Amirite, ladies?? I've been upping my levels of dread on my husband all year. So far I've trained him to do the laundry, wash the floors and give me oral until his face aches. He was a really good boy last Monday and gave me a back rub without asking. So as a reward I told him we'd go to the movies on Friday night. But he's still not showing enough enthusiasm when he gives me oral. I'm thinking of upping the dread even further. I'm going to start flirting with X in front of him and if that doesn't snap him into line who knows what I might be forced to do next. What do you think, girls?*

**""Red pillers are sexually aggressive.""** (The female version)

*I tied up the guy I dated last night and then sat on his face until I came. He struggled and couldn't breathe but was okay with it in the end. I do this to all my dates. They're all okay with it and you should do it too. Show them you're a real woman.*  (This one is a direct analogy of an rp user who said he forces his penis down the throat of all his dates and throat fucks them until he comes, and that all men should do this. This went unchallenged.)

**""Hypergamy means wanting to date your best option.""** (The female version)

*trp say women are realists who pretend romance to get the best guy they can (hypergamy) and that men are romantics who pretend to be realists. Well hey now, let's exploit men for all we get. Because we're always trying to exploit, exploit, exploit. It's what we do. It's who we are. Meanwhile, why are women who know nothing about our grand unified theory of men snapping up men? What do they know that we don't? Quick, women of our mealy-mouthed group, to the bat-mobiles and out to conduct field reports!!!!*

i do not and could not relate completely. i dont think any white person really could. but i empathize and i feel sorry for the folks who are protesting peacefully and being overshadowed by the bad apples of the crowd. i think the vandalism, the looting and the riots are indicative of thuggish behavior. its thuggish when white kids do it too, just because their favorite team lost in the playoffs. at least in this situation the protestors are airing actual and legitimate grievances, but it doesnt really justify this level of violence. maybe instead of looking at the people's skin, we should just look at the action and say ""ok, theyre obviously stupid and doing things they shouldnt be doing""

there are leaders in this community, both black and white, who are finally gaining a powerful platform to talk about the real problems and i dont want those people or our city to be negatively impacted by the actions of a select few. there are too many cases of police brutality coming to light now a days and it shows an imbalance in the system. that should be the focus of everyone's conversation. not his possible pre-existing conditions, or his arrest or whatever. thats my two cents at least...",1

"Look I don't like the idea of chromas either, and I won't be buying any myself, but people need to stop trying to ""subtly"" be like well its not a REAL skin so lemme have it for free. I'm broke as shit, I'm not a gamer really, I just love playing League with a couple buddies of mine, it's given me more sheer hours of enjoyment than any other game and they gave it to me for free. I bought a couple skins when I had a bit of extra money, namely Astronaut, and I wanted the skins for sure, but mostly I was glad that a broke ass motherfucker like me could afford to pay what little I could back to RIOT for the gift they gave me for free. Its a free game, if you like playing it then you gotta quit bitching about them trying to make money, how the fuck do you think they are capable of releasing new champions, balance shifts, and all the other fucktons of programming they have to do? Like fuck man, it's free to play, it's the most popular game in the world, it's helping gamers make the first strides towards being respected (outside of Korea) for their skills, and it's constantly evolving. That doesn't happen for free, neither do the servers, or the work RIOT is tryin to do to make competitive E-Sports a thing that people who don't game don't immediately scoff at. 

I dunno man, just seems like a lot of people do a lot of bitching about the free to play game they spend endless hours on. So you lagged for a few games, or found a bug, people always seem to rag on RIOT's programming, but fuck man, at least they're DOING it, could you? Doesn't seem like it has any more problems than should be expected for such a big game, or any more than are found in any number of other games to me. If you're playing a game that didn't cost you a dime on a regular basis, if it's something you enjoy and was made available to you for free just fucking chill out already. The game was free, now you want free access to the way they can earn revenue without making anyone pay for the game as well? Get real man, this isn't freemium shit, it's just visual changes for people who can afford to grab a look they like more, it doesn't make the game unbalanced or unfair or take anything away from you. I see people complaining that they've played so much league that they have insane amounts of IP and nothing to buy with it, so let them get some chromas with it, and I'm just like, what, really? You spent so much time playing a game that was free that you can't buy anymore content with the free in game money they give you so that it can make money and not become a pay to win game. And those countless hours of playing a free video game that let you accrue more free in game cash than you need to unlock every character and all the runes available, so you're somehow entitled to free access to more shit too? Oh but you've been playing since SEASON ONE MAN, LEAGUE WOULDN'T EXIST WITHOUT YOU, right? Well that's weird, because it didn't get this big just cause you were one of the people who got in on the ground floor, there were a fuck of a lot of people that were right that with you, and aren't asking for more free bells and whistles because they're somehow owed it since it's not that expensive for riot to make color changes? You got hours of free enjoyment, you weren't OWED that, you were GIVEN that, and you sure as shit aren't entitled to more free content. Just because the free to play business model worked well enough for RIOT to make money off of something they aren't charging their players anything for doesn't mean that they should have to give people more free shit. It means they made a great thing and gave it out for free and still made money off of it. That's called succeeding at business, and being cool people who managed to become a successful business while still making the content that they produce 100% free to play. Why don't you go make a better, more popular, free game without any incentives to actually, I dunno, pay you for your work, and then you can bitch ok? I'm fucking 24, I didn't go to college, wasn't a good enough student to get a scholarship, wasn't able to pay for it, I'm bat shit crazy with chronic insomnia and bipolar disorder, you think I'm rolling in dough? In this economy? In our generation? I have friends with four year degrees glad they were able to find a job paying just about minimum wage, because they have a full time job which they spent months and months applying and working anywhere and everywhere without ever getting hired for more than part time. Shit's tough for our generation, we're becoming adults in a world that has less and less incentive to hire us, or treat us fairly, and lots of ordinary people just born into poverty, because they aren't smarter or better or more experienced at anything than the people who are lucky enough to have a leg up, there's a lot people in our generation who just can't find work, and it's not like welfare checks and food stamps leave you lots of cash to spend on entertainment, 15 bucks for a movie that's an hour and a half long? Some unbelievably expensive monthly rate for cable, another for internet, because they're the only game in town and if you want either you don't have any alternatives, I don't even own a console anymore, but games are like what, 60 bucks? Most with like 2 hours of campaign and limited replay value? We need people like RIOT and webcomic writers and everonye else who is finding ways to make money off the people who CAN pay, and still let those who just can't afford it legally access it? Fuck man, be thankful someones figuring out new ways to produce entertainment without charging you a dime for it, especially if you're one of those people who can't afford to buy skins and shit. I mean, if the price of a chroma pack is unreasonable to you, surely anything that's not free to play is out of your price range, so you must be pirating everything else, and what with the internet service providers actually trying to catch people pirating now it's become like speeding, everyone does it, but the more you do it the more likely you'll get caught, fuck up enough and they'll discontinue your service now. Poor older hippie friend of mine got his internet cut because he got caught downloading a couple times, which was the first time I've ever seen that happen, but it proved that it can, and now he has no internet.  Be happy there are companies who realize that their are better solutions to piracy then punishing the poor and are doing what they can to provide free legal entertainment and just quit bitching already. I've been up for 3 days so I have no clue if I'm making sense, but I'm too out of it to notice I'm ranting like a crazy person til I've already done it, so fuck it, here's my 2 cents, which I will not actually be donating because I'm a crazy fucking broke as loser.

"Your argument basically is just ""That's how they've done it"", which doesn't actually counter the argument that Steam is a bad way of doing it if all you want is the DRM. Just because Steam IS the DRM doesn't mean it had to be that way. 

You don't need DRM to run locally in its own application that permanently sucks resources in the background. Starcraft II has DRM through Battlenet accounts and everything above the game is handled on Blizzard's side, and for the most part it seems to work pretty flawlessly in my experience. 

Steam is a DRM second. It's main use is for Valve to directly advertise at you to buy more video games every time you want to play a game that runs on it. I find it convenient as a client considering I have a lot of PC games and most of them run through it, but for anyone with a fairly small library I could easily see why it'd piss them off. ",1

"That has been speculated, but not proven, nor do we understand why we see this result. It would be necessary to examine the following possibilities to understand what's really happening. 

1) Men are more likely to engage in negotiation throughout their lives and are therefor more successful at it. Alternatively, women may do it less and therefore be less skilled. This may be for social and/or biological reasons and therefore not something that can really be fixed. 

2) The women who do tend to negotiate more are the same women who have more abrasive personalities that do rub others the wrong way. This is not noticed in men because more men in general tend to negotiate so there is less of a perception of men collectively being seen as abrasive when negotiating.  

3) The way in which women tend to negotiate as an outcome of biological differences is less effective in this regard than the way in which men tend to negotiate. 

4) Women aren't perceived any differently but just negotiate less as group. Women tend to report higher job satisfaction than men so men negotiating more than women may simply be a reflection of their dissatisfaction. ",1

""Forget ANY form of decent modding with Witcher 3. The devs have confirmed the engine fully BAKES every asset of the level in one giant pre-defined streaming asset, just like iD's Rage engine used in the un-moddable Rage game (and iD/Bethesda also released - uselessly- all the tools).

All the PR for Witcher 3 is BS. Anyone who doesn't believe this hasn't been following the in-depth interviews with CDPR staff. Skyrim is the world's most moddable game because the engine is state-of-the-art in how it handles every asset and script- allowing everything to be modified/replaced on-the-fly in every level. In comparison, the dreadful engines from iD, CDPR and Crytek bake a level as a GIANT CAD OBJECT- and 'playing' the level is effectively flying a CAD viewer across the giant unitary object. The ONLY easily changeable assets are the 3D 'SPRITES'- people, monsters, particles and the like.

Watching the release build videos from Witcher 3 show that even the scripting is baked into the level- which makes for 'slicker' transitions to cut-scenes, but again makes any worthwhile modding a nightmare. Ask yourself this. How many people play modded Witcher 2? Now how many people play UN-MODDED Skyrim? While many fools mock the Skyrim engine, the Skyrim engine is built from the ground up for late stage, run-time modding and this is possibly unique in the world of game engines.

If CDPR has confidence in the choices they have made with Witcher 3, then why are they still trying to sell us so many lines of BS at this late stage? I will admit I still have my fingers crossed that the promotional team are just a bunch of complete idiots, and that the unrevealed turns out to be a terribly marketed masterpiece. But nothing I have seen or heard yet gives me much hope, and the gulf between the early videos and promises and today's imminent release materials is pretty inexplicable.""

I'm just going by the fact that very obviously

lannister = lancaster

stark = york

and tyrell = tudor

but seeing as there is no viable male tyrell yet shown this is seeming less and less likely. 

I think Sansa for sure ends up as someone's queen of convenience married to which ever king ends up on the iron throne as a way to keep the north from rebelling. and that her child starts the next dynasty proper. Maybe Varys is on to something after all. 

she's the mother of Henry the 8th basically.

In Total War, infrastructure and non-combatants are targeted for the sake of total damage to the enemy nation. The ""reasoning"" being that public morale and non-military infrastructure does ultimately contribute to a nation's military machine.

I'm not saying these rioters aren't acting out of vulgarity and selfish greed, but it is incorrect to assume that damage to a city's infrastructure and private property does not provide a strong motivational effect to those in power. Perhaps even more so than a direct attack on combative targets.

I also did mention that these things are averages, and of course there are outliers that outperform. Having an incredible amount of genetic diversity is irrelevant, we're looking at a specific genotype for lower intelligence, which while we cannot yet locate given the limitations of technology today, and in defining intelligence, we can in fact test large samples of individuals and control for things that have shown to increase IQ. Things like an abundant childhood could allow children to recieve necessary nutrients which do effect average IQ differences. There are several factors considered, and your assertion that there are simply too many to model is false. We have modelled a great many, and since we know how certain lifestyles, diets, and even cultural/linguistic affiliations can effect brain development from an early age it is prudent to test for differences. Your mistake is assuming that scientists employ confirmation bias on this topic, but you should consider that scientists don't go out there to look for reasons that so and so have lower hereditary intelligence, they would simply look for the differences between certain demographics, hereditary IQ being one of them. It should also be noted that these studies are not as simple as ""black,white asian"" but rather they test subject to geographical classification, so: subsaharan africans, north east asians etc. So the models account for diversity among demographics due to various reasons. In stats practitioners must take the ""innocent until guilty assumption"" which means that they test models with a ""null hypothesis"" which states that there are in fact no differences in IQ between ethnic groups. This can be extended for various controls, and various combinations of controls are employed to check for what you call ""too many factors."" 

Also to briefly address the idea that race is a ""cultural"" construct is medically false. Medical practitioners prescribe different medicine for different ethnic groups in some cases, as there are clear discernible differences and reactions to some types of medicine. There is such a thing as ethnic culture though, and one can also test for the differences between people who hold certain ideologies as a control within the ethnic differences model. ",1

"I quite agree, it's a shame as 12 months ago I was a huge fan, but I've almost stopped watching RT stuff now, down to this and a few other factors.

1 - The constant ignoring and bashing of their own community gets a little old after a while - yes, there's shitty parts to the community that make whiny replies, but that's YouTube, and when you have as many subscribers as RT it's to be expected, ignore them. They know the fans love certain series like mini golf, trivia Tuesdays, 7 days to die, Sunday Driving (particularly annoying to hold a contest saying it would enter rotation as a new show and then make it unscheduled and make 2 episodes in the following 5 months), and they don't cater to the obvious opportunity to satisfy their fans. It wouldn't surprise me if someone at Fullscreen has commented on this, hence the recent return of some of these series and Geoff's AHWU announcements this week about fan art and community choice week.

2 - Sponsor content and the RT site - I sponsor RT to give something back for the amount of entertainment I get per week from them, because it's a minimal cost. However, it gets a little annoying that when I actually want to use the sponsor content, I have to use blip player which is terrible, or whatever flash player it is that they use for the podcast livestreams that constantly lags and breaks. Just use twitch guys, seriously. Make the livestream public and tag the Sponsorcast onto the end of the main podcast like Game Club (only not livestreamed and uploaded the next day instead).

3 - Constant commercialisation - I'm not normally someone bothered by adverts, I'm quite content to watch NFL despite being English where most people hate the adverts/game ratio and I don't care about product placement generally. However, RT constantly feels the need to churn out a T-shirt a week rather than just things people want to wear, and the number of promotional videos has been steadily increasing. This goes hand in hand with the issues with Lazer Team, particularly the following 4 stretch goals

* Office Tour video - a 4 minute short that took them ~10 months to make
* Strangerhood 2 - a running joke instigated by Ray, but offered as a stretch goal to garner more backing that probably won't happen now
* 6 new Game Time episodes involving people working on or around Lazer Team - we saw 1 with Matt, no more in the last 10 months - **wrong, 3 have been made, I missed 2 as pointed out by /u/mwiegel2 below**
* 6-8 RT Shorts - 2 of which (Fusion Confusion and McKinley Werewolf Slayer) were sponsored content (arguably 5 if you include the disappointing iBlade), 1 (12 Days of RT) was an advert to encourage more merch sales, and the rest besides Shaft Shots and Office Divorce (the eventual return to standard office based shorts like the old days) weren't really that funny.

Lazer Team itself will likely perform disappointingly for RT. The fans who are prepared to pay to watch it already have done and they're using it as funding to make the movie more extravagant. The majority of the rest are evidently prepared to wait and expect it as free content, which means no revenue there, and if they get the theatrical release they've mentioned occasionally they haven't got enough presence to get many screenings nor enough money to adequately market it enough and get many tickets sold. They're likely to take a loss on it as a whole and maybe stay away from similar content in future, which could see the demise of the fan-anticipated Day 5 if they interpret the sales to mean ""we're not interested in feature length content"" and further worsen the first point I mentioned.

I get that they're just a group of friends having fun and making a living out of it, and they'll continue to do so on the basis of their large YouTube presence garnering new viewers. But they don't have my loyal viewership anymore, and they won't grow as a company sticking to their current practices.",1

"Dostoevsky wrote in *Crime and Punishment* a dialogue about Socialists that is quite relevant to all of that:

&gt;""Everything with them is 'the influence of environment,' and nothing else. Their favourite phrase! From which it follows that, if society is normally organised, all crime will cease at once, since there will be nothing to protest against and all men will become righteous in one instant. Human nature is not taken into account, it is excluded, it's not supposed to exist! They don't recognise that humanity, developing by a historical living process, will become at last a normal society, but they believe that a social system that has come out of some mathematical brain is going to organise all humanity at once and make it just and sinless in an instant, quicker than any living process! That's why they instinctively dislike history, 'nothing but ugliness and stupidity in it,' and they explain it all as stupidity! That's why they so dislike the living process of life; they don't want a living soul! The living soul demands life, the soul won't obey the rules of mechanics, the soul is an object of suspicion, the soul is retrograde! But what they want though it smells of death and can be made of India-rubber, at least is not alive, has no will, is servile and won't revolt! And it comes in the end to their reducing everything to the building of walls and the planning of rooms and passages in a phalanstery! The phalanstery is ready, indeed, but your human nature is not ready for the phalanstery—it wants life, it hasn't completed its vital process, it's too soon for the graveyard! You can't skip over nature by logic. Logic presupposes three possibilities, but there are millions! Cut away a million, and reduce it all to the question of comfort! That's the easiest solution of the problem! It's seductively clear and you musn't think about it. That's the great thing, you mustn't think! The whole secret of life in two pages of print!""

"1.  What does this have to do with organic?  

2.  Organic isn't useless.  It's not perfect, but it's the best we have at the moment.  Why is it important to have organic an organic choice?  Most people don't understand just how problematic synthetic pesticides are not just for the environment and farm workers, but our entire society.  Did you know that one of the most popular families of pesticides used in conventional agriculture, organophosphates, has been widely implicated in severe developmental neurotoxicity issues in children?  As these studies showcase, these pesticides, found in normal amounts in children, not children with high exposure, are implicated in reduced IQ and cognitive abilities:

- http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21507778
- http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21507776
- http://ehp.niehs.nih.gov/1003160/
- http://pediatrics.aappublications.org/content/early/2010/05/17/peds.2009-3058.full.pdf+html
- http://www.ucdmc.ucdavis.edu/publish/news/newsroom/8978

Take a few minutes to ponder the ramifications; the food we eat may literally be making us dumber.  And yes, food is a major pesticide source despite what industry might claim: http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18414640 and http://ehp.niehs.nih.gov/1408197/.  Continuing on, the most important enzyme responsible for breaking down these pesticides in the human body is called serum paraoxanase.  Some people have a lot of paraoxanase activity and are able to break down the pesticides really fast.  Guess which subpopulation scientists are beginning to find has significantly reduced paraoxanase activity?  People with autism: http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16297937 -- and this year a large study found associations between organophosphates and autism: http://www.ucdmc.ucdavis.edu/publish/news/newsroom/8978.  More work needs to be done on this front, but the early findings are concerning to say the least.

The data against organophosphates continues to pile up and has resulted in the thousands of scientists represented by the Union of Concerned Scientists wanting organophosphates banned.  Unfortunately, politics wins at the EPA: http://www.ucsusa.org/our-work/center-science-and-democracy/promoting-scientific-integrity/epa-and-pesticides.html

Shall we look at all of these, ""untold trials?  Let's take a look at the, ""untold trials"" of Naled, an organophosphate.  The 2006 EPA reregistration document is here: http://www.epa.gov/pesticides/reregistration/REDs/naled_red.pdf and you'll find the list of utilized, ""Studies"" begins on page 105.  You will also find that 98% of those studies are conducted by the chemical manufacturers themselves (in rats and rabbits) and, ""Unpublished"" meaning they never underwent peer review.  Yet when independent scientists conduct studies, they are finding what I posted above, in children.

As the Union of Concerned Scientists stated in the link I posted above, ""Another scientist said that the agency ""often ignored independent scientific studies that contradicted the industry-subsidized study.""

Difference between committing an act in the name of religion, and committing an act in the name of another ideology while incidentally also being religious (or atheist) at the same time. There's no such thing as atheist fundamentalism, atheist ideology, atheist dogma. The closest you can get is anti theism, which in extreme forms might seek to actively eradicate religion.

edit:

&gt; Yeah, those damn atheist German terrorists again. /s

""Those damn people committing x act because of atheism again"", contrasting it to Salafist extremism.

Now I'll be honest and say that I know almost nothing about any modding community and simply download mods that I find interesting and go on with my life without commenting or rating them.

Hell, I didn't even know /r/skyrimmods was a thing. So at least for me as an outsider, this video was very insightful.

Now as for the no consultation part, you can say it was very apparent, but without reading Bethesda's blog post I would have refused to actually believe some companies are really that naive into thinking that. But hey, bethesda sure showed me wrong. 

I would also like to address some of your discussion points.


To my understanding and please someone correct me if I'm wrong, but Valve actually kinda had a system for this I believe.

Valve basically said you should always ask another modder if you can use his content in your mod, but you are ultimately not obligated to do so and if they had issues with you using their mods, you could issue a DMCA claim. 

Also the uploader could also divide his income between different collaborators, so this would have probably been a way for modders to agree on things.

For dealing with loads of mods that literally don't work together, I believe both Nick and Robin kinda touched on the subject. Nick basically saying ""git gud as a modder and you won't have this issue"" which was rather annoying to hear as an IT student because as one of them said, documentation is scarce and really, the only way to learn to program correctly is to fail a lot and make lots of shitty things. 

Now Robin just admitted this quite possibly wouldn't work and he couldn't see how it would. Personally, the only way I see this working is if they would bundle mods together or at least warn you about compatibility issues.

As for the quality of mods, they gave a semi-answer to that by saying that mods are firstmost made by modders for themselves to enjoy and thus while some of the mods will still be of low quality, high quality mods will always be made by people who just want that much more out of their game. I wouldn't personally say all modders abide by that creed, but I'd like to think most of them aspire towards it.

While I do agree that TB generalizes the ""consumer"" side quite a bit. I don't see how prolific modders saying they will never charge for mods are relevant to this discussion point? There will always be the selfless modders who mod, simply because they like to make the games that they love better and share said mod to the rest. There's no way to force people into selling their product and as I understood it, valve wasn't intending on obligating modders to put a price tag on their product, they only wanted to give them an option to.

Just fyi I'm not one of the people who downvoted you, even upvoted you actually as you do make a good point, and if I seem a bit rude or harsh anywhere in my comment, I do apologize in advance I'm writing most of these things off the top of my head and I really can't be bothered to double-check at this hour.",1

"Yeah, that's a really good point, and something that I think about quite a bit. You're right, most of those artists listed are not exactly my cup of tea, though I can enjoy them when the my philosophical reservations don't come into play (except FUCK Dre, he's not only misogynistic to fit the norm in ""his"" songs, he's actually a woman-beating piece of shit).

It is sometimes okay to separate your philosophy from your entertainment, but what's troubling is that participating in that entertainment is implicit endorsement of its content. If you buy an artist's music, or even just listen to his/her music and tell your friends, you are giving their voice an even larger platform, for better or worse.

I'm not saying I need to know the exact breakdown of every artist's views before I'll even consider listening to them. In fact, sometimes I can agree with an artist about most of their personal views and want them to shut the fuck up about it (for me, that's Killer Mike - sure, he's smart, but he's not *that* smart, and most of his commentary about social and political problems *in his music* comes across as short-sighted and shallow, unfortunately). I just try my best to listen to artists whose worldviews are compatible with mine, and failing that, artists whose worldviews are not overtly offensive in their art or personal lives.

All that said, I am still very guilty of listening to music that I really don't agree with. Like I said, I think about this a lot, and I struggle with it, because I believe this shit matters, art matters more than ever. Art connects people in ways that blow my damn mind. I hope that the hip-hop community continues to become more open and accepting and less about patriarchal subjugation. There are always going to be assholes, in any area, who stick to their nasty ways despite changing times and understandings of the world. Think like Westboro Baptist Church compared to Christianity, or ISIS compared to Islam. Point is, they're the vocal minority, and I wish the artists who see sexism in hip-hop would be much more vocal about condemning it than they are now.

Sorry that ended up being so long. Thanks for the interesting reply, Swagula.",1

As for your second paragraph, you aren't actually making the argument that 'hate crimes are a ridiculous idea' -- rather, you're arguing that crimes linked to religion and race shouldn't be privileged over other crimes motivated by other differences in thought or appearance.  I agree, but that has no relevance to discussion of Miliband's proposals.  I don't accept that they are 'offensive to the principles of justice'; motive has played a significant role in the criminal justice system for years, and it is perfectly reasonable to consider certain motives for the same crime to render the offence committed more abhorrent and worthy of greater punishment.

But frankly, your comments are a distraction.  The article is the subject of discussion here, and the author has mischaracterised Miliband's proposals.  Whether you agree or disagree with 'aggravated crimes' in general -- though since they've been on the statute book for 17 years you'll excuse me if I find your affected passion unconvincing --  Miliband isn't proposing making it illegal to say unpleasant things about Islam or Muslims, as the author and many commenters here have suggested.

"I'd say that at 5% you got ripped off.  Even if you made a decent amount you deserved more since you did all of the work to make the items.  You probably also had to pay taxes on what you did receive.  

I remember when game studios updated their games free of charge from the money they made on the 1.0 release.  Any extra money they received was from expansion packs, way better deals than DLCs since they were basically whole new games.

As for what a fan receives for creating extra content.  I think a graduated system is more reasonable.  Start off at the (fan) developer receiving maybe 60% of sales and as their total sales for all of their fan-made content increases their share gradually increases.  Ideally going up to 100% at some point after the studio made a lot of money off that fan's work.

edit.  Increased the first share to 60%.  I firmly believe that even when someone piggybacks off of someone else's work they deserve the majority of the sales of the product they made since they did all of the work on that specific product.",1

Right,  in which case, why was she passing stopped traffic? In hindsight,  now that the laws have been explained by other people, i know that those small lanes are meant for bikes to basically ""queue"" up to the lights but i didn't know that until it was explained.

&gt;If as most other countries, if they normally drive on the left hand side of the street as opposed to the right side, that would explain why she was on the vehicles left side and not the right.

Yes, and you aren't suppose to pass vehicles like that on the passenger side. You don't pass on the right here, so they shouldn't pass on the left there. 

Edit: for fucks sake, the first paragraph i wrote i said in hindsight, now that i understand that that's a bike lane, i know it isn't passing.

"It's NOT genetics, it's calories.  If you overeat, you get fat.  It's science.

A lot of obese people are addicts - overeating is no different from being an alcoholic, a drug user or a compulsive gambler.  There is absolutely no reason for someone to eat as much as two or three people every day.  You do not need the energy.  Your body stores extra food as fat and that is harmful to your health.

If being obese was actually genetic, the rest of our bodies would have evolved to compensate.  In other words, our knees would be three times bigger to support 300 lbs. instead of 100 lbs.  Our hearts and cardiovascular systems would also be larger and stronger to deal with extra weight.  So it's not genetics.  That's just a straight-up bullshit excuse used by food addicts.  They're no different from alcoholics who make bullshit excuses to keep drinking.

The obese should join Overeaters Anonymous and work with a therapist who deals with addiction.  Overeating is deadly - it will kill you.  So stop with the bullshit excuses and get some help before it destroys your life.  I am sympathetic, but I'm also sympathetic to someone hooked on heroin.

"You shouldn't spread ""knowledge"" of a subject you know nothing about. The ""end of it"" is called a muzzle. It is also not necessary to cover up the muzzle as long as the barrel is angled down. The air inside will prevent too much water from getting in, and the downward angle allow water to drain. The US military's weapons, as with most of the first world's weapons, must pass rigorous durability tests before being accepted for issue. These tests being soaked in fresh and salt water, left in mud, and frozen then thawed. Every weapon is then tested for number of failures and mean rounds fired between failures. The Russian Ak-47 can be fire after being *literally* filled with mud. 
Ammunition doesn't need to be stored in waterproof containers as the casings are mostly water tight. If there was a gap large enough for water to get through easily, the gun may not fire, as the round would not be seated properly in the breech. If the round was seated properly, it could increase the chance of a squib shot (lessened pressure causing a bullet to become lodged in a barrel or preventing a semi/automatic action from cycling fully) or it could rupture the barrel if the round was fully functional and able to be seated properly against the breech and bolt face. It would also decrease accuracy.  In addition, spare magazines, clips, or loose rounds (however spares are carried for each weapon) are not stored in watertight containers as it is unnecessary and would impede access in a high-stress environment. An inserted magazine, a bolt cover, the bolt face itself, and the nature of a firearm's barrel all prevent mud and water from getting into the action. As long as a magazine is inserted in the firearm, the bolt/cover is closed, chances of mud and water becoming a problem are somewhat slim. Spare ammo is carried in pouches which do the same thing, to prevent mud from entering the magazine. 

Edit: I guess firearms knowledge outside of /r/guns isn't welcome

Did global warming cause the Nepali Earthquake to occur sooner - years, days, hours, seconds?  It's dishonest to say we know.

"It seems to me that the purpose of the NYT reporting was to paint a picture showing the complex relations and emotions in the community. No looter thought, ""they didn't loan a shirt to Jerry!"" when they smashed windows, and no shop owner thought, ""I'm not going to hire neighborhood kid who'll raise a stink"" when they said they can't work here. They simply lived in separate spheres where these small slights to each other's dignity collected: the foreign/minority shop owners feeling constantly ostracized from the majority, black persons made to feel mistrusted and undignified in the shops.   

As a personal anecdote, I recently had a convenient store owner let me pay for something already rang up later the following day because I had forgotten my wallet. I never would have expected this from them, and I was filled with appreciation and moved by such a seemingly insignificant gesture. They knew my face as a regular. It made me feel part of the community like I never had before, and they are my favorite store to go to because of this kindness.   

I do not think that the inclusion of the NYT anecdote was mean't as a justification, but rather as an illustration of the community tensions. Clearly the destruction and looting were not good actions just as a broken spine received from someone that is paid to protect you is a terrible transgression, but we cannot refuse seeing the truth in a terribly strained community. No one should expect a free shirt loaned until pay day when they can manage, no one should expect a majority community to openly welcome and understand them as foreign minorities, no one should expect anything from someone else really, but when someone makes that effort to understand, to give kindness, or to open arms, now that is when you start building a healthy community. Clearly this community is unhealthy. That is the picture being painted. Don't confuse painting with justifying. Look. Try to understand. We are all people here.",1

50 years ago. 75 years ago. 100 years ago. 150 years ago. 200 years ago.

Those times are NOTHING in the lifespan of a nation. 200 years ago my ancestors were slaves. 150 years ago we were fighting pop-up laws designed with the intention to keep us poor and un/under educated after we were finally declared human beings. 100/75 years ago we were still fighting these same pop-up laws and were being murdered if we dared step out of line with little to no legal recourse. 50 years ago segregation was decodified. 

And today we are told ""get over it"" even though MANY of the people who suffered those LEGAL injustices are still alive, and most black adults are 2 to 3 generations removed.

Y'all talk highly of immigrants but we aren't fucking immigrants. We are Americans...the immigrants who get here (by way of legal travel) already had the drive and the funds to do so. The poor people of that immigrants race, the disenfranchised, etc...are still in that immigrants country being told to get over shit.

"So, here's an article designed to disparage short people. Literally, it's trying to ""prove"" that short people are incompetent and *deserve the wage gap*. Now isn't a smart time to be making the ""it's all in your head"" argument. When there is an article about it, we aren't making it up. And why do you need to bring, ""you're short and obviously blame all your problems on tall people and women"" into this?

I can't deny there is *slight* evidence for the IQ gap. The problems in these studies are that they don't control for people with stunted growth and cognitive ability due to malnutrition being included, and are often done with children, not adults. IQ differences can be found between races, genders, and other demographics as well. Shall we start ordering salary by stereotyped intelligence level? Height is by far not the determining factor for intelligence, nor is ""IQ"" the only relevant measurement. Being taller *does not automatically make you a smarter and better member of society*, you have to consider everything.

This isn't India, this isn't a ghetto in China, and this certainly isn't Darfur. This is AMERICA, where this shit isn't supposed to happen.

Rape is clear, rape is simple, and rape is easy. If you aren't sure you were raped then you weren't. The exception is drugs, which are visible in your system, or *EXCESSIVE ABOVE ALL ELSE AND NEAR DEADLY* levels of alcohol consumption that leave you not ""drunk"" but leave you in unconsciousness and etc. The exceptions don't warrant an all sex in this scenario is rape approach, like our idiotic drinking policy, but encompasses an approach of taking these cases more strenuously than other cases because consent given while drunk but rescinded when sober is false but consent violated while drunk is true rape.
 
When it happens rape is serious and horrible, no exceptions what so ever. Rape when left unreported and evidence is non existent leading to a case founded on he said she said allegations should not ever be investigated because they can't be investigated and thusly will always come down to a guilty or not guilty verdict based entirely on hearsay.

And just for the record, the Foundation isn't legally required to list a single donor if they don't want to.  They hire the best accounting firms, then hire an auditor to check them, then publish it all online for anyone who wants to see.  Most of their tax forms  are over 25 pages.  Re-filing tax statements on a Foundation that deals in hundreds of millions of dollars is not really unusual at all.

All you actually need to do is PROVE they've done something illegal and we can end this right here --- you win.  In the meantime all you have is your right wing talking points and innuendos.

&gt; **Before the interview began, Robert Downey Jr’s assistant had spent two hours fretting about getting the temperature in the room just right.** He needn’t have worried. For as the Hollywood star joined Lorraine Kelly in a hotel suite for a chat, **there was just one thing on his mind.
Miss Kelly has revealed that as the 49-year-old actor sat down, he blurted out: ‘Nice t*ts.’**

&gt;The ITV breakfast host, 54, who has a 36C bust, said: ‘Robert was not quite himself. He had a time in his life when maybe he was discovering himself, having issues. He came on looking a bit worse for wear and he had no shoes on and he wandered around and he sat down and I said hello and he looked at me and said, “Nice t*ts”. It could have been worse. He could have said, “Oh, I don’t like them”. It is a difficult thing to respond to.’

&gt;Downey Jr’s comments were all the more surprising because Miss Kelly had been primed to think his first concern would be how hot it was. Speaking on tomorrow night’s Jonathan Ross Show on ITV, she said: ‘We were in a hotel room waiting for him and a minion came in and said the room was too hot. He kept coming back every ten minutes saying “The room is too hot. Robert won’t like it”.‘The man had a Robert Downey Jr thermometer. Anyway, Robert came and he was fine. He didn’t know what they were talking about.’

We don't need every last right winger's opinion on SJWs...  I don't need to know that Ann Coulter has a problem with liberalism.  And I do know that Stacey Dash claiming something as crazy as ""The government would make women into an entitled class"" is something open for facepalming at her.  

First off... Why in hell does everyone care what a celebrity thinks?  Stacey Dash is an actress best known from Clueless and being a conservative female (I guess).

But here, she claims that government is going to make women an entitled class.  How?  In 2 minutes, I see a shouting match more than a reasoned argument.  

""The pay gap is a myth and I'm sticking to that"" and there's no way of actually getting into why it's not a myth or if it's so.  That's what comments are for but her's are on Twitter... The WORST place for a longer discussion in the history of social media.

Come on, people...  Why bring this up as if this is all about feminism?  Who cares?

This is not relevant to gaming, it's a mild attack on SJWs, and overall, the value of this piece is just to rally a few conservative viewpoints over a better long term discussion about ethics in any form of journalism.  It doesn't even work as a proper rebuttal because I doubt that Ms. Dash can prepare something in the time given to really do it justice.

When people talk about the wage gap, it's usually because the CEO of Lockheed Martin (who's female) is making less than her male counterparts (who are usually male)  So instead of $4 million (example) she might make $2 million.

Just ignore that a male and female working at Wal Mart make the same $7.50, or how restaurant workers make $2.15 an hour, we'll just focus on what the big girls make and leave everyone else out to dry.  That's the wage gap.  Until there's an answer for why CEOs make 300x - 400x the pay of the average worker, the gender wage gap focuses on exactly the wrong thing to hide how fucked up our society truly is.",1

&gt;the genius at NASA trying to advance our civilization?

Of course, of course, of course innovation is important and it is necessary. But in order to advance our civilization we also need to maintain its foundation. People who develop technology do nothing to determine how that technology is actually integrated into society. They tend to be detached from the same society that they are trying to improve. They do not necessarily determine how it will be made affordable for the majority of people. They do not have to ask about the implications it will have for future generations. Good scientists ought to have substantial training in the social sciences and in philosophy in order to maximize the effectiveness of their work. They must be taught from an early age to see all the facets of things and to understand the value and reality of their society and fellow people.

"It's not actively racist, but I think making the ""good guys"" white is just a symptom of a more fundamental issue, and that's the assumption that white is ""normal"". If they made them black, or asian, or hispanic, they wouldn't be normal, they would stand out. A black elf wouldn't be able to just be an elf, it would be defined by the fact that it's a black elf. And obviously, the fundamental nature of this issue means that the only way to overcome this issue is to include more of those group in films as not defined by the fact of their skin color, but just as a person (once again, the black elf isn't a black elf, its just a regular elf just like every other elf.) 

In terms of the ""bad side"", orcs tend to be various shades, so I wouldn't call them black. Nazgul, Spiders, Wargs, etc. are all portrayed not as black the race, but black as in the color (black the race is honestly not referring to a color, black people don't actually have black skin. It's just a word that's been decided to refer to that particular group.) Finally, the men of the east being bad is less a racial thing and more a symptom of the world. They're right freaking next to mordor, and Tolkien also may have had some old world assumptions about the east that carried over to their design, but we definately do see evil men coming from all racial backgrounds.

It was so easy to convince congress that Iraq had weapons of Mass destruction because a decade earlier we sent them the tools and ingredients to make them.

This continued despite Irans vocal complaints about chemical attacks

&gt;The first reported use of chemical weapons occurred in November 1980.[6] Throughout the next several years, additional reports of chemical attacks circulated, and by November 1983, Iran began complaining to the UN that Iraq was using chemical weapons against its troops

This continued despite America shooting down an Iranian civilian aircraft in Iranian airspace, while the American ship was inside Iranian waters.

Edit:  Also, I really hate that reddit doesn't seem to understand the point of the 77 cents on the dollar statistic.  No serious academic thinks women are just straight-up paid 23% less.  Most (including the article that was on the front page last week) put the gap, after controlling for everything they can think of, at around 2-4%.  That's still unacceptable (ask yourself if you'd be willing to pay a 2% penis tax on your income; if the answer is no, you should be a feminist), but that sort of straight-up discrimination isn't the point of the statistic. 

The point of the statistic is that society, in the forms of guidance counselors, teachers, family and friends, channels men and women into different career paths, and that the careers women are channeled into pay less.  Society tends to pay ""feminine"" jobs less than ""masculine"" jobs taking the same amount of training. Look, for example, at the difference in pay between pediatricians and radiologists.  Similarly, our government only mandates that businesses give ~~women time off to raise children, not men~~, unpaid time off, and relatively little of it, forcing more women into the childcare role than might otherwise choose to take it on (look to Sweden for a good counterexample).  Neither of these things is really a conscious discriminatory choice on the part of any one actor, but they *are* real effects with real consequences for womens' incomes.

Edit: Edit:  Anyone want to explain to me which particular part of my post the downvoters are taking issue with?  Nothing I've said is particularly controversial in either the sociology or economics communities.  Hell, it;s basically exactly a rephrasing of the article that made it to the front page the other day, but with a few lines on *why* people make the choices they do.  Does reddit just like to pretend people make all decisions in a vacuum?",1
"I guess I meant what I said in the context of the movie, he does make compelling argument about taking responsibility for the riots and the harmful nature of gang culture. I think the main problem with his argument is that he underestimates the damage that slavery and institutional racism caused to these communities, causing them to develops the issues they have. I think a lot of the destructive attitudes and behaviors in black culture comes from lasting disenfranchisement and resentment. Vineyard says in the video that African Americans have had since the end of slavery to catch up. Anyone who knows anything about the history of the United States should know that apart from no longer being property, African American gained very little in terms of equality I many place for a long long time. I tend not to try and get into anything race related just because it's kind of a clusterfuck of half truths. It's ridiculous to riot over race, it only serves to perpetuate stereotypes and damage your community, but at the same time there are serious issues with our system and how it deals with issues in black communities. It's frustrating discussing it because people can be very passionate and justified on both sides of the argument. ",1

I think you are letting your ego in the way to understanding the deeper issue at hand.  
Reason, logic and science is not what alienates believers it is how they are used to mock and belittle believers.    

Equating atheism with intelligence is counter-productive and false.  
The real reason people stay religious is because they are not open to accepting change.  
Humans are habitual creatures and we loath change, this applies to secular and non-secular issues.  
Specially when it comes from an outsider telling us that ""our ways"" are incorrect and we must change.   
History has shown no matter how logical a proposed change may have been, people fight tooth and nail to keep the status quo (their customs and rituals) just as is.   

The point here is that atheist if we are trying to get people to leave religion, we need to start planting seeds of wonder and doubt so they can begin to accept small changes at first.   
Forcing logic and reason is not going to do anything, that is why majority of debates between scientists and theists end up in a stalemate and both sides leave grinning thinking they won.   
All the logic in the world is not going to change their minds, it will only further entrench them in their religion.   
Calling theists stupid, ignorant or any type of mockery does nothing to get them to change their minds.

What would make anyone in this situation want to fight the man, aside from his gun remarks in passing as a defensive statement. As a person in that scenario, why would you want to incite violence on somebody making a point that the general populous agrees on and would most likely be agreed upon within that store- the fact that an elderly man stood up for his morale guidelines, explained to the younger generation why the word has such demeaning manner, and in doing so made a good point from his experience in life. If that was a racial remark (your comment) it is quite out of line to be the most upvoted comment on this post.

"Here's how the Saudi's are fucking idiots:

It's in your country's long-term strategic interests to make the other country consume its natural resources, preferably to exhaustion.

That's where they are fucking up. If they continue production at the levels they are, they'll dry up fracking production in the United States. This is a strategic mistake, because it leaves our oil in the ground, while they consume their lone natural resource, at a price that is rock-bottom. We trade dollars (which we control the value of) for their natural resources, which are theoretically finite.

Eventually, the Saudi's will run out of oil (or at the very least, get the least amount of dollars for it in return.) Since the US controls the value of a dollar, that's probably not smart.

If they run out of oil, they'll have dollars, which we control the value of, and which we can steal (or using banking rules, eliminate the value of their dollars, while preserving the value of our dollars). We will still have oil in the ground, which the market will value very highly and which we'll charge a premium for. And since we control the world's banks, our checks will cash. While their's wont.

The Saudi's are fucking idiots. We're just waiting for them to run out of oil, or if they don't, to receive dollars for it, the long-term value of which we control, and can destroy the value of their dollars by eliminating them from the financial community. When they run out of oil, we won't have any reason not to turn Mecca and Medina into glass.

Which is precisely what is going to occur. After we steal all their money, or destroy their ability to spend it, increasing the value of our dollars.

I don't think the mythical community needs people like him in it.  He should stick to his day job.

I've made a couple of stupid Skyrim mods.  If it weren't for the community, I would have never figured out how to create them.  If it weren't for the community, I would not have had any place to share them, get feedback on them, and improve them.  Most of my mods were based on prior work, so never in a million years would I have considered charging for them, even if Valve said it was ok.  SMIM is entirely based on prior work as well.   He didn't create new models.  He pushed a few polygons around on existing models created by Bethesda employees.  Now, he did this on a massive scale, so there was a time investment, sure.  Does that mean it was alot of hard work, or that he just isn't very good at it and it took him a long time because he's slow?   I dunno?  I'm not trying to be a prick, but for him to even entertain the notion that the work he did rises to the level of being worthy of payment is simply disturbing.  

How about I take SMIM, and push a single polygon on every model he touched, then released it as my own work and charge for it?  How is that really that much different than what he did?  How many polygons need to be pushed before it becomes my work?  In an uncurrated workshop, I could have a field-day stealing mods, making trivial changes, and reselling them.

"Yeah, that's why I said I'd have to rely on Shia hadith for offering my proof. Not that there is *any* proof that the Imams of Ahlul Bayt are Sunni.

&gt; And if that's the case we're stuck at the same impasse

Pretty much why I didn't quote the myriad of proofs in Shia books that the Shia Imams are Shia in my first comment. When you asked that's when I provided.

&gt; And I did not, and would not ever insult the Prophet or his family.

Not you, I was talking about /u/derintellectual who had the audacity to lie about the 12 Imams, after all they had done in their lives to set aside (what they and the Shias will call) the straight path, from all other interpretations that came after the death of the Prophet, it is an insult to their magnanimous legacy.

&gt; It's also not fair to say that everyone else has to prove their claim except you, because we already know. If A sunni had said that it wouldn't be an argument.

I beg to differ. If everyone knows the sky is blue, and then /u/derintellectual  says the sky is orange and always has been orange, then the burden of proof is on them. The unfairness comes when the people who claim the sky is orange demand proof saying that the sky is blue. When the 'sky is blue' person says that the 'sky is orange' people have already deleted anything that doesn't fit their views from their sources, so they'll have to rely on their own sources, the 'sky is orange' people say we don't accept this, and because you haven't brought something we can accept, then we're not going to bring proof either. (Even though in their own sources it still doesn't say the sky is orange). In this way, the 'sky is orange' people successfully evade having to provide any sources, and say oh well you go your way, we'll go ours.

Either way I have provided two of the many proofs that the 12 Imams are Shia, and not Sunni in the modern sense. They did however uphold the true Sunnah of their grandfather, Prophet Muhammad, and we do as they did.",1

This whole story is a real interesting exercise in unmasking pseudoskeptics. 

That said, while the vacuum test was overdue and really necessary, and eliminates measurement error due to thermal convection (iirc) this could still be due to some sort of obscure experimental error. 

This is the status right now:

https://www.reddit.com/r/Futurology/comments/34cq1b/the_facts_as_we_currently_know_them_about_the/

An excerpt:

&gt; We KNOW that it's very likely that the results are spurious, and that is why we are dedicating so few resources to the tests that the team didn't even have vacuum rated capacitors for over six months. But we also KNOW that a positive result, however unlikely, would be a world changing discovery, and so the possible reward is great, while the extremely limited resources we are committing to the project give us little risk.

&gt; And finally, we KNOW that the teams involved at the moment are well educated, well trained, experienced researchers dedicated to figuring out what is true, not what people wish was true, and so we should have little reason to criticize the researchers personally for their involvement in such a project.

I want this to be true, actually everybody wants this to be true, because it's another step towards the Alcubierre Drive we all want to see realized. This discovery if real might mean it could be only a few hundred years away.

This is real research done by real NASA scientists but it's important to not get our hopes up *too much*.

We'll have to wait another agonizing six months for more significant results...

This is what I personally find most intriguing:

"ITT:  Butthurt white people.


EDIT:   Wow, gold? 5X? Thanks, kind strangers!  This really blew up!

Since we're on the subject, let me just say how very funny and enjoyable it is, in a very painful and bitter way, to watch the white race be rapidly outclassed in many fields by those who it once disdained, and who we considered to be genetically cursed to toil under eploitative systems of our design.  Now we white men of the west watch as we become the debtor nations, ruled by corrupt and inept juntas, our societies rotting from within.    Payback is a bitch, and there should be much laughing in Beijing, Mumbai and Tokyo when we are made to swallow our versions of 'structural adjustment,' the austerity plans we had such fun constructing as debt peonage traps for others in the recent past.   

edit:  don't take this the wrong way, I'm actually enjoying this, because we were such smug imperialistic asshats.  Probably not going to enjoy being reduced to serfdom, but it's a small price to pay to point and laugh as the once mighty roll in the dust.  Twas ever thus.",1

Do you think any rapists would go ""well, I was gonna rape someone tonight. but oh well, ok.. if you say so, I guess I won't"", just because the mayor says not to?

Converesly, many women probably will listen to wise, simple precautions on how to protect themselves and consequently it may reduce the number of assaults.

And you make the assumption that the mayor is doing nothing to focus on the men. I'm sure he's working with the police to work out the best ways to make parks safe, and I'm sure he's doing his best to get the rapists caught. Just because he's publically adressing women, doesn't mean he's not privately addressing the men, It's possible to do both at the same time.

If H is a function on a discrete set, like the number of people tased this second for each second, then good luck defining an integral on a discrete set.  What you want is a summation instead.

That's all ignoring the unit problem.  If the value of H(x) is in people tased per day, then your blind attempt to integrate over the interval from 0 to 45 looks pretty silly.",1

Why did the universe have such low entropy in the past, resulting in the distinction between past and future and the second law of thermodynamics?

What is the nature of the nuclear force that binds protons and neutrons into stable nuclei and rare isotopes?

Why is there a discrepancy between the amount of lithium-7 predicted to be produced in Big Bang nucleosynthesis and the amount observed in very old stars? (The current generation of cold fusion folks seem to be making interesting headway on this one.)

"The receipt:

&gt;Dearest Amg552,

&gt;First of all, from every one of us at WiNGSPAN Delivery Services to you; Thank you so very much for your large order.  It keeps our children fed, and it keeps the delivery vehicles on the road.

&gt;Why, our very own Black Aivo's loving wife of 13 years had just been diagnosed with Space Cancer™ just this past week, and during this period of mourning we were uncertain about the future.  With your gloriously large order of our hand-crafted artisanal munitions we have all agreed to donate to his family of 5 (He, his wife, and their 3 Guinea Pig children) the entire profit of this order!

&gt;Chance Ravinne, known for his shrewd Scrooge-like tendencies was hard to convince of this generousity, but some ""creative bookeeping"" does show our costs as a bit higher than they actually are...  So what he sees as ""at cost"" actually has a healthy margin built in, and so we were able to convince him by still giving him a cut.  He's a shrewd taskmaster who we all fear the retribution of.  There was this guy once...  Really, it's not fit for out of corp discussion.  I'm shocked you would have asked.

&gt;Honestly, again, from the cackles of our hearts. Your generosity is mind shattering.  Could you be our new CEO?  He's so very mean, and someone such as yourself would surely treat us with so much more care, compassion, and love.  Our bunks have exposed nails, and I sleep with but a threadbare blanket to keep me warm when our single lump of coal has burned out for the night.  19 of the delivery crew have developed spinal problems in the past few months.  Morale is low.  Send help.  CONCORD save us.  Be our savior.

&gt;Please?

&gt;Attached, according to our strict delivery receipt protocol is your delivery order:
&gt;Kill: Amg552 (Kronos) 

&gt;I'd like to personally welcome you to the WiNGSPAN family of customers.

"While I find myself largely agreeing with Sanders on issues of non-interventionism as well as civil liberties, his economic policies are atrocious.  Secondly, I don't think reddit is rallying behind Sanders (nor do I think it rallied around Paul in 2012), but only /r/politics and its overflows are. 

So in terms of economic policies, to make it simple I will ignore the fact his chief economist supports MMT, which most mainstream schools of economic thought believe will lead to high amounts of inflation, which will disproportionately hurt the poor.

One big thing Sanders doesn't support is free trade. I know he is anti-NAFTA, but I'm sure he is also opposed to any sort of trade agreement in general, even though they lower prices (which disproportionately helps the poor). In fact, nowhere in mainstream economic circles can you find someone who says free trade is anything but beneficial (except for the workers/businessmen in the industry that is opened to greater markets, as their profits/wages would decrease).

Secondly, he supports a federal minimum wage of $15, which [even bloody Salon](http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2015/04/the_fight_for_15_it_s_a_bad_idea_raising_the_minimum_wage_to_15_would_hurt.single.html) says is stupid.  I believe there should be no minimum wage, as they serve as an unnecessary barrier to entry or low-skilled workers into the labor force and I believe as a policy it disproportionately hurts the poor (and minorities, which is why minimum wage laws were actually originally enacted explicitly to dispossess blacks, Asians etc of their jobs across the globe). 

Lastly, perhaps the biggest no-no is that he is a command style socialist who believes the government should run pretty much everything. Almost inevitably, this leads to greater income disparities and creates a neo-serfdom of those in the government vs everybody else and generally is only in the interest of industry insiders. Once again, this sort of policy disproportionately hurts the poor the most.",1

"&gt;  Whether Shias are muslim or not is only a debate amongst people who are also debating whether or not the taliban are fighting a just jihad in pakistan and people who opposed Pakistan Movement ie the crazy people.

Uhhh... no. The Taliban, Al-Qaeda, ISIS, etc. weren't around when these people lived. These are some of the most respected scholars in Islamic history. Imam Malik, Ibn Taymiyyah, and Ibn Hazm are crazy? It'd do you well to show some respect for some of the most prominent scholars in Islamic history.

&gt;Anyone who believes in 1 god and end of nabuwat is a muslimm.

Well, many scholars disagree with this, to be quite simple. The Hanafi Madhab holds the position that blasphemy is apostasy. Also, denying the Qur'an is apostasy, actually there are tons of condition for apostasy and what constitutes as an apostate. You should read into it. Ahmadis are not Muslim because they clearly deny the Qur'an and the Sunnah. This is a nearly unanimous opinion amongst scholars. They deny the fact the Prophet Muhammad (saw) was the last Nabi. Not everyone is Muslim just because they say they are.

&gt; You claim shias started 25 years after the death of the prophet that is simply not true. Any history book will tell you the division amongst muslims started day 1 after the prophet died over who should succeed him, it has nothing to do with 25 years.

Umm, no. Actually you should read into the Shi'as history. Initially it was a political movement in order to support Ali (ra) and then slowly became a theology (at least, that is the Sunni argument) after the death of Husayn(ra). This is what Ibn Hazm is talking about. Also, it is quite arrogant of you to think you know your history better than Ibn Hazm.

&gt; The Wahabi Sect is one that is 200 years old .

Not sure what this has to do with *anything*

These scholars are 1300 years old not 200. This has nothing to do with Wahhabism, Salafism, etc.

This debate goes back to the actual Salaf, not ""200 years"" because of those danged Wahhabis.

&gt; Taqqiya refers to concealing your faith when you are being persecuted ie living under ISIS or under the many anti shia Caliphs that have ruled the arab world over the past 1400 years, there is no vast grand conspiracy hiding true shia beliefs. Anyone can go and buy a Shia book on fiqh and find out what they believe. Anyone who brings up Shias and Taqiyah is incredibly ignorant of the vast persecution shias have faced historically and they were forced to hide their faith not to advance it but to protect thier lives. In Nigeria, shias do not even tell their children they are shias in case the child accidentally mentions it at school and the family gets killed Boko Haram Style.

Umm ok? Im not debating what Taqiyya is or isn't. I'm telling you that it isn't agreed upon by Sunni scholars *at all* whether Shi'as are muslim. By the way, there are legitimate debates on when it is permissible to use Taqiyya, and some Shi'as are far more liberal than others with that use.

&gt; Its a matter of debate whether being a companion of the prophets makes you immune from criticism not a matter of debate if Shi'as are muslim

Who says companions of the prophet are immune for criticism? Literally nobody argues this. I've seen this from so many Shi'as and they are just arguing over a strawman because this isn't what any Sunni scholars actually says. Nobody thinks that the companions are infallible (well of course, other than the Shi'as thinking that Hassan, Husayn, and Ali (ra) are infallible).",1

"That's a debatable point. Ruining more games now to get fewer ruined games later. Will developers actually get something fixed quicker if an exploit ruins games? Yes and no. Yes, it will be higher on their priority list. No, it's not going to make them work any faster.

By abusing this exploit, it became a higher priority because it was ruining. But if they weren't abusing it, it wouldn't be ruining games and we wouldn't need a fix so badly. Who knows if them ruining games actually made the process significantly faster. Sometimes stuff like that helps, sometimes it doesn't. Rarely do we ever find out for sure.

This sort of a predicament is really restraining queens like Pearl from truly flourishing in the competition and can make her come across as boring and unimpressive which may have caused some of the loss of interest over Pearl in the community (apart from the young twinks on social media who don't know a thing about drag and just watch the show to talk about it with their friends and gag over Pearl).",1

Bottom line is that (unsurprisingly) a journalist got extremely liberal in their interpretation of people, places, and events. 



The Boston article introduces Eron as having first met with the journalist in question at a diner- except that they'd been communicating for months via email. Implication is that Eron initiated all of this- which isn't actually true.


Journo claims to want to represent Eron's side of the issue- this of course broke the first rule of journalism, journalists are not to be trusted, or to make it sound less paranoid and more cynical, they're almost always after what will move papers and drive page hits, not what's objectively true.


Journo claims Eron said he was probably violating his own gag order (which is incorrectly called a restraining order- these are two different things and require different actions to drive a judge to issue one) by speaking, but actually Eron was saying that someone would probably try to said that if the article was actually published. Quite the opposite, Eron told Journo that this all had to be strictly off the record. 


Eron points out (again) that people seem to think that what he posted wasn't true in the Zoe Post. Journalists still like using non-committal weasel words. It either did, or it did not, kind of like how we can prove that Quinn herself said that she'd participated in Helldump but now claims not to have. Quinn's said *nothing* to the validity of Eron's claims, but apparently her silence is refuting? At any rate.


Journo reduces what was a 3 hour conversation into a few sentences-

&gt;Gjoni can be relentless that way. And in others. He maintains incessant eye contact from behind a tangle of dark, wavy hair. He is intensely focused. 


Except that Eron didn't maintain eye contact and has ADD- *anything* that's distracting him will draw his focus. 


Journo goes on-

&gt;There’s a haunting resonance to Gjoni’s choice of location for our meeting. This is where he and Quinn first hung out in person: It’s where his obsession with her began. 


Eron's vegan, which in nice terms, yes, even in New York City, means he has an extremely narrow selection of places to eat. Never mind the issue that they'd first hung out a dive bar- per Journo's own admission- but apparently now they're meeting for the first time at the vegan place.

Being 'incapacitated' does not require the person to be unconscious (although that certainly qualifies). As said earlier, level of sedation matters. A person can be capable of carrying on a semi-coherent conversation and remember nothing 30 seconds later with the appropriate pharmacopoeia.

"Philosophy no longer is the source of order for the world, nor the voice of truth. It merely occupies fringe position of an insignificant criticism. As such it is less significant to human culture and power structures than, lets say, film criticism. It is powerless, and as all powerless plays the game of aligning with this or that available pre-determined political or cultural option. It is dry as a source of inspiration and sterile in it's endless unconscious repetitions of the historical discourses. Philosophers are not creators, just compilers of available themes, which they no longer understand, not even feeling obliged to immerse themselves in rationalisation of their own words. They fail to revolutionise the framework of thinking, giving ground to technology, economy, and plain old historicism.

Philosophy moves only through mere impetus of the previous ages, without creating any new movements, sustaining itself only through mildly sucking out notions from other disciplines and juggling them around. It is an empty wordplay lacking any substance of direct real-life engagement in forms of policy or captivating public reason. It no longer defines itself anew, it was put into servant position by the modern money &amp; status oriented academia. It became a contradiction of real meaningful thinking, and that is why it seeks prosthesis in different cultural forms. It no longer occupies a strong active position.

That is what I mean by impotence of thought. And I see it's major issue.

"It's kind of a silly motion to simply say, ""Hey, we're putting an all male cast to make the interactions between each other more real.""

I suppose from a realistic point of view, I ""get"" what they're saying. A lot of my buds and I do tend to act pretty lax and what-not versus with the opposite sex(That is unless we know them well), but isn't that the whole idea behind character progression? 

In fact, would they not hinder any sort of character progression by making the cast entirely male and familiar with one-another? Of course it can still play a major role, but it's a lot more difficult to create progression when everyone's personality, attitude, etc. has already been set with the group of friends, or ""cast"" they've been molded with.

It just feels like a cop-out to avoid writing in female characters they feel would be devoid of any meaning, which they should just say instead of going with the, ""We wanted to create a truly bromance type of feel &amp; the opposite sex would hinder that idea"". 

I won't doubt that the relationships between the group will probably be a highlight of the game though, but it's silly to make it seem like gender would pose some sort of obstacle.

Games with great bros have been made. People here have mentioned Mass Effect, Gears of War has got some great bros too and they mentioned Uncharted as well.

I think the main difference is, we're going to be doing a lot of exploring and other activities in the world of FXV. They're probably going to create a ton of interactions &amp; dialogue to keep you interested while travelling, so they're probably thinking of ways to keep the conversations and such interesting by perhaps trying to take ""Bromance"" to the next-level.

Seems pretty strange considering the story of the Good Samaritan is one of the most well known in all of Christianity and deals specifically with loving those who are despised.

[Church attendance and gays](https://www.google.com/search?rlz=1C1CHFX_enUS596US596&amp;es_sm=122&amp;q=racism+and+church+attendance&amp;spell=1&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=qtZCVaajI5GwogTg5IDQBQ&amp;ved=0CBsQvwUoAA&amp;biw=1600&amp;bih=775#q=church+attendance+and+gays)  This one should be obvious but the only religious group(never, occasionally, monthly, or weekly attendees) that still opposes gay marriage are weekly church attendees.

"You're right, I was misremembering and thinking that our unpaid leave policy applied only to women.  I concede that point, though I would point out that 1) Because most people think of family leave as maternity leave, many men (myself included, apparently) are unaware they can take time off, and 2) We give relatively little time off and it's unpaid, which means that the incentive is to get back to work ASAP.  These factors combine with the biological fact that women have to recover from childbirth to mean that the vast majority of time taken off will be taken by women.  In countries with paid leave, the percentage of men who take time off is higher, and in countries where some of the paid leave is reserved for fathers, the percentage rises further still (indicating that many men would take time off if they felt it were an option, despite the fact that paid leave usually pays less than their ordinary salary). This indicates that something is causing them not to take time off, and I'd contend that that something is social influence.

And 3) You ignored 80% of my post to nitpick one fact.  I'll concede that you're right on that one, but please, educate me further.

I also run my own servers, so have been lucky enough to spend a lot of time monitoring and blocking crawling/bots etc.

I am going to have to disagree with you: it is not extremely helpful, nor even remotely effective.

If you add it to your robots.txt this is what you will get if you run it through the testing tool:

&gt; Line 2: Crawl-delay: 1         Rule ignored by Googlebot 

Neither will malicious bots will take any notice of it.

Google ignore any crawl delay settings either in robots.txt or as meta tags for one simple reason: webmasters that don't know what they are doing add them, and can potentially cause harm, slow crawling of a site etc. 

Google recommend the use of Google Webmaster Tools to set any restriction on crawl delay, however again to repeat - this is not a good idea - unless you have a site with huge 500k+ amount of pages and very poor quality/shared web hosting.

"Even though I'm obviously a huge advocate of legalization I can't in good conscience vote for Trudeau because of how bad almost all of his other policies are.  Trudeau is on the wrong side of nearly every other issue, many of which are more important than cannabis, and it's sad to see many in the cannabis community throwing away their values to become single-issue voters.

Fortunately the NDP does have a two-step plan to legalize and given [the long Liberal history of lying about reform combined with the NDP's history of promoting it](http://www.reddit.com/r/canada/comments/3417lt/health_officials_back_vancouvers_plan_to_license/cqqsah5), I think it's probably more likely to happen under Mulcair than Trudeau.  Ironically, we may be able to do the right thing by *not* voting for legalization but voting for the NDP and putting people over profits, privacy over security and the environment over pipelines.   The Liberal Party is just bad for Canada.

"I'm fairly sure it's not entirely paid off yet? I'm gonna guess that Ozil and Alexis were incidental. When players of that quality are available, Wenger will get them where possible, and he did. 

Yes, we could afford it, but I don't think we should expect massive money spent every year. Unless a big name player becomes suddenly available, I think this year we will see a few cheaper (when I say cheaper, I mean £5-20m) signings. 

The kind of signing I think we might make is Nabil Fekir. We've scouted him all season supposedly, and we'd probably get him for £15m ish. He can play across the midfield, and he's young. That's what I expect this summer. Young and Versatile players.",1

"I have had to do the same thing. After season 4 I was really kind of angry. I didn't think it was that bad all around, and there were great parts but the stupid parts (Crasters, Yara being the lowest point of the whole series IMO) as well as obviously drawing out and hollywood-izing fights (Karl Tanner, The Skeletons) drag down not only the season, but the entire show as whole. A show can only be as good as its worst episode. Thats why the Sopranos and the Wire are still to my mind the best TV shows ever. Was episode 4.10 not packed enough or exciting enough? Who needed a million dollar fight with skeletons and fireballs? The Oberyn/ Mountain fight was dramatic and the type of thing GOT and ASOIAF is good with. I would have taken a seasons worth of the Wall under siege in a more low key display of action than bullshit for 8 episodes and then an epic and overblown Hobbit style battle with huge anchors in the wall and giants arrows making guys fly. It was cool and all, but thats not why I like this series.

 I want to say I still enjoy the show mostly but I do recognize that as far as the writing is concerned, it is very much a pale shadow of the books. Its not just about volume and detail- film has extraordinary tools at its disposal like music, acting, directing and combined audio-visual motifs so on and so forth. I am a big cinema fan (Kubrick is the greatest) and I am very interested in what can be expressed and presented in film in ways other than being written like a play. We expect it to be different, simplified, streamlined. But it can do that in major ways while still being artistically sound. I would rather the show be radically different but stand better on its own as an artwork telling its own story successfully than to have a great book adapted confusedly with great production values. The writing is the only thing I have ever complained really about though, not the actors, music, direction, sets, landscapes any of that. Its all very good, its just the writing is rushed and sloppy. There are moments of greatness, but as the task gets harder with the later books, there is more and more laziness, and not having the courage of its convictions. Thats what bothers me most. Like the Sparrows in the books have an important thematic point. The wars of the highborn have absolutely trashed the lives of thousands who are starving and being preyed on by bandits who sack septs and rape and kill members of the faith, while the highborn cynically plot and scheme and drink their summer wine. In the show they are fundamentalist christians who are stupid and hate gays and sex.",1

"I agree with you in principle, but I think too many moderators will lead to increasingly disparate moderation, if that makes any sense lol. What I mean is there's already differences in different mods making different judgement calls, and Id like them to get more on the same page if that is possible. More mods could just mean more variances in moderation, and that could create the appearance of unfairness and make posting here a craps shoot. 

I think the other problem with what you propose is that moderation probably doesn't happen all at once. Some days they might have little to do, and then a surge of comments will come in with a big story and they'll be behind for a few hours. Personally, I really value timely moderation (which comments for each comment removed) because sometimes, a bad post will actually produce good children. 

I really hope the mods look at what's underneath the comments and posts they delete. As a discussion sub, the point of moderation should be to encourage discussion. The delete button isn't always surgical, though, and good, or at least well intentioned comments could get nuked with good ones. Basically, that's why I just wish the mods would back off a little with the deletions, and I would even like to see more feedback on what gets deleted, but I only see what's left up more or less, so I don't have a full picture. 

Maybe mods don't always have the time to explain when they remove something, but who says it has to be an all or nothing thing? They can do it some of the time, or when they have time, or when they have reason to beleive the commentor being moderated is engaging in good faith, or is usually a good member of the community (which is one of my big issues when it comes to bans, because if a good member has a bad day and gets banned, they are gone for good, whereas real trolls will just come back with a new name). 

Another option would be to have a few premade responses to copy paste, or numbers that refer to  explanations in a Wiki. Like 1 would be ""do this again and you'll be banned"" and 5 would be ""off topic"" or something.

I plan to have her a tutor starting next year to teach her coding so that she can develop that skill along with her language.

Of course I have high expectations for her but she can never ever disappoint me so this is not one of those situations where the dad beats the kid for not throwing the ball the right way.

But I am truly sincere when I say a firm understanding of STEM will be required by us. But I will try to do it in a way that is interesting to her.

Let me give you an example, the girl is only 2 and so far she loves DRIVING! it's amazing. she wants to be in her little play scooter we have for her, and when she sees a car (even a strangers car) she will hop in the drivers seat.  It's pretty interesting.  The girl loves driving for some reason. Sometimes I will take her out in the parking lot with a helmet on and we have this 49cc scooter that I allow her to sit on with me and I will drive around in circles at 2MPH and she loves it. 

Now let's say that her obsession with driving continues unabated.
Fine. I will build her a go-kart, I will take her to the track and allow her to run it with kids her age I will encourage whatever passion she has. But that in no way stops the opportunity for me to teach her STEM.
How does that ICE engine work that drives that kart?
What exactly is lateral G forces and how does friction affect the tires as you round a turn?
Why do we want to straighten out our turns by using a racing line? 
If we reduce or increase the mass of the kart how does that effect the performance?

In every single thing that you do in life there is an oppurtunity to understand the science behind it. I hope to give this to my daughter.

"&gt; That's a LAYOUT control 

No it isn't, in WPF, behavior versus layout and appearance are completely separate. You clearly have no idea what you're talking about.

In WPF there are several `Panel` derived classes which provide layout functionality:

  - StackPanel/VirtualizingStackPanel
  - DockPanel
  - Grid
  - UniformGrid
  - WrapPanel
  - Etc.

The `ItemsControl` does NOT perform layout. It leaves that task to be performed by the corresponding panel. The `ItemsControl` generates UI elements from a `DataTemplate` corresponding to an underlying DATA object. So it's all about Data, and nothing to do with layout. Now show me how to do that in winforms, please.

And no, winforms doesn't have *proper* databinding, but that depends on your definition of ""proper"". To me, ""proper"" is something that is actually usable without having to resort to a bunch of useless retarded HACKS that steal my time by forcing me to write useless platform specific code, where I could be using declarative XAML, DataBinding and platform agnostic ViewModels.",1

"Read all of this one. it's worth it:

A senior in high school is getting ready to ask his friend to the prom. He's known her for years, but he's scared that she might not say yes. So he plans. He plans and plans and plans, coming up with the perfect way to ask her out. Finally he says fuck it. He just goes and asks her. She says yes. 

Now there's just a week left before prom, he realizes there's a lot of more he needs to do than just ask a girl to go with him. He makes a list. He and his girlfriend need to find a tux, a dress, and a limo. Luckily for them, they can find all that stuff at the mall.

First thing they decide to cross off that list is the tux. Of course since *everyone else* is just as scatterbrained as him, there's a *huge* line stretching all the way out the door of the store. People have been standing for *hours*, just waiting and waiting to get their tux rented. There's nothing else they can do though, so the couple decide to wait. They wait and they wait. They wait and wait and wait, and *finally* they get into the store and get what was apparently the *last* tuxedo the store had. 

Next on their list is a dress. Luckily for him, most of the girls at his school had their clothes planned out months in advance.  Unfortunately, his girlfriend wasn't one of them. So he waits, he waits and waits, feeling like he might as well still be in line at the tux shop. Finally, after only three hours, his girlfriend finds a dress she likes and decides to buy it. 

Two days before prom night, he realizes something. He never finished his list. He forgot the limo rental! He jumps out of bed, sprints out of his house, and makes it to the limo rental just as it opens. There's a line. It stretches on and on, out the door and all round the block. He doesn't know how its possible but at this point it really doesn't matter, all he can do is wait. So he waits. He waits and waits, inching forward with the other poor souls in the line.

Finally, the night of the prom comes. The two arrive in their limo, they get out, and are promptly greeted by another line, this one for a breathylyzer test. Apparently some helicopter moms had forced the principal into adding this. So the couple waits, they wait and wait, moving ever closer to their goal. A few people ahead of them don't pass the test, but the both of them do.

Once inside, the two are dancing happily and both are having a great time. When the song is over, he goes over to grab them some food. As he comes back with the food, he sees her fall to the ground, a crowd of people clustered around her. Someone near her yells ""QUICK! GO GET HER SOME PUNCH!"" The boy doesn't stop to think why she needs the punch, he just runs for it! He get to the food table! He sees the punch! And, thank god, there is no punch line.

The United States ranks respectively 14th and 15th on Democracy and Freedom of Corruption. Denmark ranks 1st on both. (http://www.worldaudit.org/democracy.htm)
Denmark ranks 11th on the 2015 Index of Economic Freedom. The US ranks 12th (http://www.heritage.org/index/ranking).

"For abortion to be murder you'd need to be killing a conscious being. Sperm, eggs, and the fetus within the first trimester all are without a functioning neural system. They have no consciousness, so the argumentative point of saying that abortion is murder is factually incorrect. If you want to make some silly argument about how ""it was going to be a life"", well then every sperm, and every egg wasted is equally a ""waste of life"". The very concept is asinine, to be against abortion is just to be meddling with the freedoms of women doing what they want with their body.

"Everyone saying these dams are the best solution really have no idea what the reality of hydrolectric power is. I think it would be great to bring more power to the people of Brazil and improve their outdated infrastructure, but these dams are just going to bring more development to areas *along* the Amazon and its' tributaries.

People somehow assume that if I'm against the dams, I must not care about all the people living there, which couldn't be more true. The greatest natural resource of Brazil, and one could argue our entire world, is the Amazon basin. I don't want to see it go the way of America, which suffered from *massive* and widespread deforestation. 

Many people don't realize North America used to be covered in old-growth forests. Incredible ecosystems that are now found in only a few select spots around the world were wiped out *forever* because the people cutting them down didn't realize what they were doing, they just saw the huge trees as a quick and easy way to make money. We can't take what we did back. In a hundred years when Brazil's forests continue to dwindle and the Amazon is a polluted shithole like the Ganges, people will look back and say they made a mistake.

EDIT: And another great example of something the United States fucked up royally and many communities are now paying for it is our own dam infrastructure. We built a huge number of dams in the early half of the century, oftentimes damming up entire rivers. Many of these dams are now in disrepair and quite dangerous. Removing a dam is not an easy task, and repairing a badly planned and inefficient dam is not ideal.  When you place gigantic walls at intervals along a river, you drastically change the way fish migrate along the river. Even with fish ladders and other solutions, many fish simply can't make it and the ecosystem suffers over time.",1

No, I love Davos but him highlighting this quote from the Night's Watch vow is clutching at straws. The Night's Watch are there to prevent humans from extinction/ alien enemies, not each other.

"Do you know that the Syrian army entered Lebanon to stop civil war in that country as reponse to appeals from Maronite leaders? Both Maronites and many Muslims welcomed that move then. Syrian presence was under Arab League mandatory and expired in 1982 during Israeli and their radical buddies(Phalanx, SLA, A-T) siege of Beirut. In 1986 Lebanon requested an end to the Syrian presence in Lebanon, but the civil war continued so syrian foces stayed. In 1991, a Treaty of ""Brotherhood, Cooperation, and Coordination"", signed between Lebanon and Syria, legitimized for second time the Syrian military presence in Lebanon.
Lebanese people are not homogenous and they were divided on the supporters and opponents of the Syrian presence so you can't talk about the unanimous attitude about Syria and their leadership then or today.
As we have seen during the last presidential election, an enormous number of Syrian refugees in Lebanon showed their support to Assad and desperatly tried to vote for him.
http://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/may/28/syrians-lebaanon-vote-assad-embassies-refugees-boycott

Maybe this would help you to asume attitude of Lebanon citizens about Syria more precisely. In the sciencific research(at the end od 2013.) of Gallup, one on most famous world research instututes based in Switzerland, people of Lebanon voted for greatest threat for peace in the World. Only 4% see Syria as biggest threat to them, but 41% see Israel as such, and 23% see United States as greatest threat. So according to that unbias research, combined 64% of Lebanese see Israel and United States as greatest threat vs 4% who see Syria or 16 times less.

The debate ultimately became one struggling fishery or the other, but the kicker was that krill oil has quite a few benefits over fish oil. I can't say I chose the right way in terms of sustainability but I have to think the consumers that take krill oil are far outnumbered by fish farms using it as food, which is just another reason why these farmeries can do more harm than good.

"This portion of the paper really drove it home for me originally:

""The occurrence of such extreme, sharp spikes in VOCs in air at GZ indicate something other than the behavior of a typical structure fire. Oxygen influx as a result of shifting of materials within the pile might have created an increase in combustion of material in localized areas. But these spikes in VOCs, at levels thousands of times higher than seen in other structure fires, suggest extremely violent but short-lived fire events. Probably the most striking spike in toxic air emissions, found in EPA monitoring data, occurred on 9th February, 2002. Note (Table 1 ) that this was nearly 5 months after 9/11, and after nearly all the debris had been cleared from GZ. In fact, the levels of some species, like toluene and styrene, were some of the highest observed at the site. But the levels of benzene and propylene detected on that day were far above previous measurements, at 610,000 and 990,000 ppb, respectively. Other VOCs were measured at their peak levels on this date, including 1,3-butadiene at 400,000 ppb."" ""EPA also monitored very fine particulate matter (PM) and other sizes of PM. PM is probably the most reliable indicator for the activity of structure fires, as such fires are generally known to burn incompletely, and produce PM that drifts up and outward from the source. EPA data from the West Broadway sampling site, the location closest to GZ where PM was monitored, show the following trend in very fine PM (PM 2.5 , or all particles \ 2.5 l m) in October and November 2001 (Fig. 4 ). These data show that the peaks in levels of very fine PM near GZ correspond to different dates than the peaks for the previously discussed combustion products. The five stron- gest peaks in PM 2.5 levels are centered on 23th, 26th September, and 3rd, 10th, 20th October, closer in time to the events of 9/11. None of these dates correspond to the dates of five peaks in VOCs noted above. Additionally, it is clear that the levels of PM 2.5 emissions rose more gradu- ally, and died down more gradually, indicating slower fire dynamics as might be expected from the burning of the organic materials previously thought to exist in the WTC. These data suggest that the greatest level of fire activity, associated solely with the typical fuel sources expected in the WTC, was completed by the third week of October. That is, the materials expected to burn (incompletely) in a structure fire, producing PM, were largely burned off by mid- to late-October. Therefore, the extreme spikes in air concentrations of the five VOCs noted above, particularly on 3rd, 8th November, and 9th February, point not to other sources of typical combustible materials but to other forms of com- bustion. Such forms of combustion appear to be violent and short-lived, and thus similar to the effects of energetic materials, like thermite""


The ""official story"" literally cannot account for the VOCs measured by the EPA at Ground Zero.",1

In reply to abhikavi on [""Teachers of Reddit, What's the worst thing you have heard a colleague say about a student? (NSFW)""](http://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/34fvry):

&gt; A lot of people say that rapists know what they're doing and they know it's wrong.
&gt; 
&gt; I've heard far too many comments like the one above to think that's true. It's alarming how many (otherwise normal-seeming) people legitimately think that it really doesn't count as rape if she's drunk, if she's wearing something revealing, if she's a 'slut', etc.

&gt; For the most part I agree with you but I think you have overlooked a very important distinction. Having sex with someone who is drunk is NOT rape. Having sex with someone who is incapacitated by alcohol most definitely is rape. A person can be drunk and still have the ability to consent, it happens all the time. I think most people understand this but these lines seem to get blurred in conversation.

Sad

The facts presented are very sad. It is true, blacks due have a higher rate of arrest in some of the areas. But what is really interesting is 
&gt; In 2013, 68.9 percent of all individuals arrested were white, 28.3 percent were black, and 2.9 percent were of other races.

Another interesting fact is 

&gt;  African Americans Make Up Nearly Half the Youth Detained for Drug Offenses, But Use Drugs at the Same Rate as Whites (Source: Crime in the United States, 2001. (2002) Washington, DC: U.S. Justice Department, Federal Bureau of Investigations.)


Yet blacks only make up 13% of the population and whites make up 63.7%(pretty close to the % of white arrested). I guess we as Americans should consider why blacks have such a high rate of arrests versus the rest of Americans. Could it be the poverty that many have been brought up in? The lack of education due to the poverty? The lack of quality jobs due to the lack of education? Could it be that they are more frequently targeted by police?

This automates the behaviour tracking process, freeing people to spend their time and energy on more productive things.

On top of the behaviour tracking, it would be pretty easy to write a script to let you know if you're under-hydrating by certain time during the day, or if you were trying to consume or limit a certain number of calories via liquids (common tactics in weight gain/loss), or if you wanted to limit how much alcohol you consume in a night - I know a lot of people can't track their drinks properly.  Huge applications.  Hopefully one day there will be something like this for solid food too, although that would be a lot trickier.

Plus it's cool and has a great design.  I'd probably buy one if it was effective (I'll wait to see reviews probably), affordable ($119 is bit steep for me), and the lining is shown to not contain any materials that leach carcinogens.

"1.  Spanish (and romance languages in general) are not as easy as they're portrayed.  Frequently they're touted as ""a good beginner's language"", that is a good first choice for someone who wants to start learning languages.  They're actually *very* different from English, the only thing they have in common with it, really, is a lot of loanwords.  If your primary criteria is how easy it is (for an English speaker), go with Norwegian or Swedish.

2. Japanese is not hard.  *Written* Japanese is hard, and even then it's only hard in terms of the characters you have to learn (not the grammar, syntax, or vocabulary).  Spoken Japanese is *shockingly* easy: it uses no phonemes that are not in English, meaning you don't have to learn any new sounds, pronunciation should be a cinch, and the grammar and syntax are relatively very simple (much, much simpler than most other languages, certainly massively more so than English).

"&gt;  Just kick kids who act like this out of school.

What does that solve? That kid goes on to make 2-10 more kids equally raised poorly because they themselves were both raised poorly and abandoned by the system.

You then have more problems than the 1 that you started with.

And the parents are probably bad parents because they themselves have come from a long line of poor families poorly raising their kids and without the kids ever getting outside influence to push them into something better.

The problem worsens every generation. You HAVE to put a concerted effort into improving the underclass. If you don't it just gets bigger and things just get worse.

It isn't even the kids fault they're like this. A baby doesn't come out of their mother's womb born to be a useless shitstain and burden to society. They come out neutral, a blank slate that the world is ready to impress its ideals and teachings onto. These children turn out like this because society has ignored the underclass for all this time, ignored the criminal class, ignored rehabilitating society in order to eliminate the further production of problem children.

At some point you have to realise that, unfortunately, it is society's fault that these kids have become who they are, and society's fault their parents were, and so on and so forth. Society needs to take responsibility for it and to end the cycle. Better systems, in better countries, have recognised this, and do significantly more to rehabilitate and educate the underclass rather than just ignore it and say ""fuck it, it's their own fault"".

This fat, wheezing woman was limping her way to the door holding her sad looking kicking dog in both arms. I stood there for what seemed like minutes waiting for her to get decrepit body (rivaled only in patheticness by the poor animal which had apparently suffered it's injury when ""somehow a car door closed on its leg"").

As I stood there holding the door,  I realized that I was potentially giving up my place in line to this sight for sore eyes. I felt like a larry David character as I suddenly no longer wanted to do the right thing.  But now I was stuck. And then there was a second door about 10 feet into the building.  When I realized she was not even going to attempt to lift an arm to open the second door herself (her arm weighed more than the tortured terrier, but she could have easily opened the door herself) I begrudgingly offered her the second courtesy.  She thanked me and made her way to the sign in form which she hovered over for waaay too much time. 

I wasnt surprised that she didn't speak up that I was ahead of her. It pushed my appointment back a solid 20 mins. I felt guilty for making my gf and her cat weight out of my stupid reverence for unreciprocated civility.

In my registered accounts, my top paying dividend stock is Surge Energy (SGY), although I cannot recommend them wholeheartedly as it is a risky and volatile play due to relatively high debt. You have to do your own DD. Prior to the oil drop, they had one of the highest div yields on the TSX, but had to cut the div by 50%. Still good at around 7%. But its the total return potential that drew me to this one; it was hit very hard. As it is volatile, i have traded in and out of this one once, but have kept a good amount as I am optimistic on oil this year and next. Total Return plus divs so far is 53.80%.

My favorite dividend stock is WCP, also O&amp;G. Great management and much more stable than SGY. Div Yield is 5%. Wish i bought more of this. Total return plus divs so far is 48.21%.

I was sent some press samples from Siren Song, and I've been sitting on them because my experience with customer service was irritating and I don't want my emotions to effect the review.

Basically, Siren Song's stated TAT is 5-7 business days. It ultimately took two months for them to get to me. About a month after the owner agreed what she would send to me, I emailed her to ask if she had a tracking number for me, because I never got my package. She said my package hadn't been sent, and she was behind on a lot of aspects of her company, so she would send my samples out the following week. A few weeks pass, and I e-mail her AGAIN to ask for a tracking number. She gave me one that day, but it sat at ""pre-info sent"" for a few days. It looked to me like she had printed the shipping label, but hadn't taken it to the post office. She told me that since they were free samples, she had put sending them on the back burner.

Okay.. that's kinda fair. However, it would have been nice if she told me that from the beginning, not when she gives me a tracking number two months later. First I thought my package had been lost, then I thought I might never get it from her. She took so long to respond to my emails, too. I was worried she might have dropped off the grid.",1

Reagan isn't a  politician anymore, but his opponent, Carter, wanted to ban all semi-automatic firearms . . . which are the vast majority of firearms sold today.  Carter also wanted to ban all inexpensive guns, effectively stripping away the right to bear arms from those who were poor.

"You may be laughing your ass off, but i'm dead serious: a marathon where donations go straight into the pockets of the runners and staff for entertaining us.  Like Twitch donations, which are paid for that very reason. Not because of some cancer charity that maybe pockets 90% of the money for 'administrative costs.' for all I know.  In fact, if I had to bet, I'd say at least somebody in the administration of this event is getting paid by the charity for organizing the event. (If not, they should be for how much money they bring to the PCF and DWB)

I know, the altruism angle gets a lot more visibility for speed running, and I think it's a great thing. Just, why not have an additional GDQ-branded marathon sometime where it's nothing but debauchery and fun and not bogged down with rules to appease the charity's PR department.

"First of all - Kirk is not a kid, either when he goes into Starfleet, or when he's thrust into the Vulcan crisis. We're to understand that he's wise beyond his years, and like his dad, is basically fearless. He promises Pike while initially boarding the shuttle that he'll do in 3 years what normally takes a talented cadet 4 - to captain a ship.

Consider that in ST the Spock origin scenes alternate with Kirk's. The point there is to establish them as near-equals. But then Kirk bests Spock's Kobayashi Maru test, challenges him at the disciplinary hearing...to me, this is a rushed version of the same dynamic of the original series, where Spock had to be taken down a few notches, over time, to be Kirk's friend and number 1, as opposed to a perpetual scold.

Can a cadet become a captain in 36 hours? Sure, and in real life, too. 

Suppose that Kirk is at the top of his class, is the most senior trained cadet in being a captain (since not every Starfleet officer seeks the most challenging position), and he's easily the salutatorian to Spock's valedictorian. If Kirk is clearly the top student onboard a ship full of cadets, with Spock being the grad student TA, what's problematic about the field promotion?

There are at least a few instances in US history, and I would imagine in many countries, of rather dramatic field promotions. It's rare, but it's never contrary to meritocracy.",1

They've competed at some of the highest levels and know what it takes to succeed - though it should be the right player. Kaka is the right player, Marquez...not so much.

Big names also help put butts in seats. Butts have to pay for the privilege to occupy the general vicinity of those seats. Those butts often like to dress in team apparel with their favorite player's names on their backs. So big names are investments, and if they pay off, that money can be reinvested into academies.

Also, if I had a choice between the way Laravel was designed with how easy and flexible it's public API is, and Symfony's supposedly more SOLID design, but AWFUL ([downright hard to use](http://www.reddit.com/r/PHP/comments/3054vt/ircmaxells_thoughts_on_the_design_of_apis/cppwc75)) API, I would choose Laravel's less-than-academically-perfect design any day of the week.

What's more is, the maintenance of Laravel is Taylor's purview. Whether the router class has 6, 60, or 600 public methods doesn't impact me because I'm not maintaining that part of my application. As such, I really don't care about its internal architecture as much as I care that it's easy to use and saves me lots of time. And Laravel is in fact easy to use, and does in fact, save me lots of time.",1

Yes, those that commit more crime are more likely to get arrested.

&gt;Do certain races happen to have demographic/socioeconomic trends that also correlate with the rate of reported arrests? 

I have no idea what you're even asking for here? What demographic trends? Their race is a demographic trend, but the entire report splits it into many different factors. Read about it here:

The Bernanke piece sounds fairly incoherent if you understand the Fed powers. Perhaps he was pointing out through a question that the Fed was bailing out banks and not the little guy, as in pointing out that the system was rigged. He certainly came off as ignorant *if you know the facts*. Although I'd say that he isn't alone in that. Plenty of politicians are ignorant of the Fed, like Ron Paul, who has suggested equally obnoxious things. His son Rand does as well with the whole audit the Fed nonsense.

I haven't looked into whether or not China is manipulating their currency. I will say that both Obama and Romney accused China of manipulating their currency in 2012, so it doesn't seem that far out of the mainstream. I'm not a forex guy and don't follow it.

The rioters are the type of people that are keeping blacks down. They DESTROY sympathy for black people among everyone else, they destroy their own communities and then blame white people.

Isn't hunting down voice packs a tedious thing to do? Is it really worth it rather than just play and appreciate the dub?

Thanks for reading the article. The reason I included it is because many people are stubborn and whiny about not getting Japanese audio in their games, when they usually don't understand why game developers are unable to do so. Then they start avoiding the games themselves, which sends the message to the publishers that nobody wants to play these games in this foreign market, so they'll stop localizing, which I'm pretty sure most people wouldn't want.

I mean, you'd rather have a dubbed game than no game at all, amirite?

The best comparison we could come up with is that feeling you can get in the middle of a forest, or out on the ocean, or in a cathedral. When everything is quiet and your heart swells at this wonderful world you are part of. The sense of belonging to something that is bigger than yourself. That's kinda what it is like looking at my daughter. And that's just when she's quiet; the heart-swelling, soul-filling contentment. And then there's the pride when she learns something new, the joy when she smiles at me, the delight when we're giggling together...

Yeah. Totally worth it.",1

"The combo rule is actually one of the few that are totally sensible, here's why.

Because EDH is a social fantasy game, every player is here to feel like they were a part of the epic story this battle became.  Players feel like they're part of a story when they contribute to the direction the story took.  Now, this doesn't mean they're the winner in the story, but they do want to be a character, not an NPC who sat there and extolled the virtues of the local provisions shop while the hero did his thing.

To this end, combos alienate players from the overall narrative of the game.  If my opponent uses a Lab Man combo, all the damage I've dealt him thus far (even if i've got him down to 10 life) is ludicrously pointless.  It just means I was tooling away at something that ended up not being relevant to the story.  Essentially, everything I'd done in the game was worthless.

That's shit.

For a social game, at least.  For a tournament, absolutely, beat your opponents at a game they didn't realize they were playing.  But don't sit in the corner and declare yourself the winner, telling everyone to stop having an exciting battle now because you have a card that says you won.",1

We'll endeavour to do what we can as a council to ensure our areas, our footways and the parks are well lit and give people that sense that they feel safe.

&gt; Trusting others too much invites trouble.

Here, trusting is a completely innocent act and there is no connotation that the person deserves the trouble. Invites is used in this context to mean that the behavior allows for the result to happen more easily. Yes, a woman walking alone allows for her to be raped more easily. No, that's not ok.

"I'll try to answer your question:

Approximately 50% of police are against it according to the Police Association.

Let's be honest; a significant portion of police get off on over-exuberant use of force. They rely on the person they're inflicting that on to be of bad character and so unable to be a credible complainant. Usually it's low-level stuff, not unfamiliar to a rough game of footy. It's exceedingly rare that we get mugshots in the media of crooks who've been genuinely worked over (unlike the US). But, I'm not upset if they catch the guy who burgled my house and they give him a couple to the short ribs if he gives them any grief.

With cameras they're able to be monitored more closely, and those minor things start to become reportable incidents.

The question is, do we want a police force that's even more standoffish than it currently is? Or do we want a couple of hard-men to come running when we send up a distress flare? 

There are Pros and Cons of both scenarios.",1
"Gamer here whos mostly seperate from the issue and Ill attempt to give you the most unbiased opinion I can. So from what I understand a female game developer slept with game reviewing men and that led to people thinking the games she made were better than they actually are due to biased reviews. Lots of gamers got very mad over this because such ethics in regular journalism would get people fired, and so they want gaming journalism to be held to the same ethical standard as regular journalism. In general it was an outcry from the gaming community for better journalism for gaming as a whole.

Now the woman centered in this ethical questionability somehow received support from the feminist community which misread attacks on this womans character for her dishonesty as ""typical misygonist gamer behavior"" and decides to take a stance against gamers. Feminists, supplying the arguements that they usually do against the gaming community enraged the gaming community because they not only have to defend themselves from what they believe is untruthful feminist propaganda, but also because this feminist intrusion is overshadowing the ethical issue that gamers actually want dealt with.

TLDR: Woman in gaming jounalism was unethical. Gamers react with outrage and call out for ethical improvements. Feminists mistake the outrage against the woman for her ethical behavior as some sort of ""typical gamer misygony"" and ran to the womans aid blindly. Gamers are frustrated because they have to fight feminists on another front and the true issue is lost in the confusion.",1

&gt;**Prisoner in van thought Gray was ‘trying to injure himself’**

In addition to this someone posted in a comment on another thread that the driver of the police van is African American.

To add to this, the policy to restrain him in a safety belt was only 3 days before this happened so when people are saying police violated protocol not restraining him that's only part of the story. It's likely that when policies like that are adjusted that there is a period where officers need to learn/adjust just like everyone else mostly.

I don't care who we're talking about; even the worst criminal has basic human rights and the government of all entities should abide by them. I'm literally stunned that people care more about petty revenge for property crime than the serious fight over human rights going on right now. The police should not have the power to kill a person on a whim. The police should not have the power to hold a person in jail indefinitely on absurdly high bail for vague charges. The police should not have the power to coerce unconstitutional searches. These are important issues. The riots are important too, but what they're *about* is the issue here.

&gt; Almost as quickly, the identities of the two victims were revealed: A young, big-eyed beauty and a grandson of a prominent cleric, who to make matters worse, was engaged to be wed, but not to Ms. Akbarzadeh.

So this jindeh was already engaged to another woman and he's off chasing this young woman and already cheating on his wife-to-be, khak to saret bishore kisafat. Was it really worth it? What bugs me even more is that if a police officer had stopped them they would have just bribed the officer or threatened to have him fired. 

&gt; “Good riddance,” someone wrote on Ms. Akbarzadeh’s Instagram page under a picture of her posing with a ring studded with diamonds in the shape of a dollar sign. “This girl set fire on normal people, now she set fire to herself.”

"&gt;African Americans Make Up Nearly Half the Youth Detained for Drug Offenses, But Use Drugs at the Same Rate as Whites

That survey is extremely misleading, first it counts alcohol as a drug. Yes white people may binge drink more than black people, but that's hardly comparable to something like crack.

But more importantly its SELF-REPORTED data, which makes it completely unreliable. This self-reported survey of drug use has actually been completely debunked by academic research, which compared whether different races report using drugs in these surveys and then actually testing their urine samples to see if they are telling the truth. It found that blacks are 20 times more likely to lie about using cocaine:

*""This study provides evidence that compared with other groups, African Americans provide less valid information on drug-use surveys. The findings suggest that African American respondents had significantly lower concordance rates""*

http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3455900/pdf/11524_2006_Article_433.pdf


The more accurate way is to look at the data provided by the US Department of Health, which releases reports every year on how many people came to the emergency room while on drugs. They find that blacks are [3.5X more likely to go to the ER because of elicit drugs and 7.2X more likely to go to the ER because they are using crack.](
http://www.samhsa.gov/data/sites/default/files/DAWN2k11ED/DAWN2k11ED/DAWN2k11ED.pdf)

So while African American self-report that they have the same drug rates, the reality when tested shows they are lying.


&gt;Could it be that they are more frequently targeted by police?

Blacks actually make up for 40% of drug dealers, despite being 12% of the population. Whites make up 29.9% despite being 64% of the population. So statistically they should be arrested at a multiple several times higher than whites, its not that they are ""more frequently targeted"", its that the commit more drug crime and hence get a higher arrest rate:

""According to the federal Bureau of Justice Statistics, of the estimated 225,242 sentenced prisoners under state jurisdiction serving time for drug offenses in 2011, 67,271 were non-Hispanic white (29.9%), 91,775 were non-Hispanic black (40.7%), 47,479 were Hispanic (21.1%), and 18,717 (8.3%) were unaccounted for or not specified in the report.""

http://www.bjs.gov/content/pub/pdf/p12ac.pdf

&gt;Education?

Actually black people get tons of scholarships and have lower requirements to enter university than any other race. It's called [affirmative action.](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Affirmative_action_in_the_United_States)

Baltimore for example has one of the highest educational spendings per student at $2,108, higher than white majority cities like Portland ($1,269), Seattle ($1,101) or Boston ($1,672).

http://wallethub.com/edu/cities-with-the-most-least-efficient-spending-on-education/9390/#main-findings

Blacks with much [lower admission scores than whites are picked and accepted into colleges](http://www.jbhe.com/features/49_college_admissions-test.html
), simply for being black: 

In 2012, the mean critical reading SAT score for college accepted students was 428 for blacks and 527 for whites. For mathematics, it was 428 for blacks and 536 for whites.  For writing it was 417 for blacks and 515 for whites. 

From: [US Department of Education](http://nces.ed.gov/fastfacts/display.asp?id=171)

&gt;poverty

Somone above has already covered this beore. There are 19 million whites in poverty and the the total homicides commited by whites is 5,286, while there are 10.9 million blacks in poverty and the total homicides commited by black is 5,890.

So the rate of homicide is 54/100,000 for blacks living in poverty and 27/100,000 for whites living in poverty. Nearly 2X larger for blacks as for whites in poverty.

So even if we look at those only below the poverty line, blacks still commit murder at 2x the rate.

&gt;The lack of quality jobs 

This definitely feeds into it. Employeers do not want to hire those who commit crime, that's why we do crime checks at our companies. And since blacks have such high crime rates, they find themselves harder to employ. It's a cycle I can imagine.

&gt;Perhaps recent events will help open a dialog about the racial issues that still plague America. 

Well until we can openly talk about instead of continually telling black people that all of their problems are continually caused by relentless white opression at all times, everywhere, then we can move on. The culture of black America must change, and it really is about culture and not race. African immigrants for example tend to not have anywhere near the issues with crime that black Americans have who are born here and grow up in the ghetto culture that glorifies crime.",1

Doesn't answer the question. Nor does your link even get close to what my rhetorical question is posing.

&gt; Yes, those that commit more crime are more likely to get arrested.

So, for example, racial profiling would not be a non-trivial counter explanation?

Age would be a key example demographic. ""whites, ""blacks,"" and ""others"" do not share the same demographics or socioeconomic standing. There are trends within the groups.

"I think you're confusing interest and excitement with belief.  A story like this is obviously going to get a lot of media traction because it represents a tiny glimmer of hope that we might escape this planet prior to our species' extinction.  I mean, we can see 13 billion light years of stuff to explore in every direction... and so far we've managed to visit the moon.  It's likely that humanity will never exit our solar system.  That's depressing.  So this story excites people and ignites the imagination, but that doesn't mean everyone believes it and doesn't warrant your patronizing rant.  I'm very interested to see what follow-on experiments show.  I hope they show this is real.  But my expectation is that this will go the way of faster-than-light neutrinos.  So you need not shit on my hopes, I'm well aware of the odds.

I'll also point out that your examples are conveniently chosen.  There are many examples of results from experimental science that ended up being true but which were inconceivable from the perspective of theoretical science as it was understood at the time, and many scientists reacted at the time as you have: with derision.  A good example is the first experiments that were showing that light traveled at the same speed regardless of the relative motion of the light source and the measurement apparatus.  This is really the most exciting thing about science, and it's how science works.  Someone measures something un-explainable.  Science casts its critical spotlight upon it.  A flurry of scientific effort attempts to unravel the mystery.  Usually, it turns out to be nothing and we just learn a what went wrong, but sometimes it's real and then we've learned something new and amazing.  Those times are the best times to be a scientist.  Your willingness to declare this junk science (even if it most likely is junk science) before the truth is known seems to show a total lack of passion for science, and instead a desire to lecture on how you're right and everyone else is stupid.",1

"&gt; I'd place more reliance on the FST than a blood test in real world scenarios

The law prohibits driving while ""not having the normal use of mental or physical faculties **by reason of the introduction of alcohol** [or] a drug . . . into the body.""

Driving with a medical condition causing nystagmus or with poor coordination isn't DUI, either. If OP's wife's blood work comes back negative for any alcohol or drug, the field sobriety test should be irrelevant, unless they want to charge her with some kind of bad driving offense based on her actual driving performance or claims he was on some drug they can't test for.

And whatever ops are launched with 4.0 are then supposed to last 1 year.

I guess fans need to be more specific when they ask them questions at cantinas: ""will there be another drought of instanced 5+ boss ops?"". I'd like to see Jesse Sky wiggle out of that one.

No wonder Zorz quit. And no wonder BW never says anything concrete about their future plans for PVE. They know it will piss off the players that matter. Unfortunately for them, people can read between the lines.

Shadowrealms has really hurt BW Austin and TOR. They lost the resources sunk into SR, which in turn lost the goodwill of EA and the respect of other BW offices, and TOR is directly worse off for this detour when they could have been charging ahead full steam.

"&gt; Killing renly was good and it was just. Renly was a traitor, and practically speaking the worst candidate for the throne. Balon could take the north, joffrey could reign for a hundred years of torturing people, danearys could go mad and burn down kings landing, and it wouldn't compare to the damage renly would cause by taking the throne ""Because he would be good at it"", as he put it.

Please, if you are going to attempt to defend the tired argument about precedent then the exact same complaint is true for Stannis.  Seeing how Stannis has no evidence to his claim of the twincest thus according to the majority in the realm he is equally usurping his nephew and the rightful king.

Actually, thinking about Stannis actually sets a more dangerous precedent.  Seeing how Renly's precedent relies on the challenger being popular while Stannis does his action all while being unpopular and having no support.

Moreover, Renly's precedent works to ensure that realm doesn't have to worry about being ruled by douches and monsters like Maegor, Aegon IV, Aerys II, or Joffrey as because of their personalities that will obviously drop their popularity within the realm which means they will be effectively challenged on their rule and likely deposed.

Finally, if anything Robert's Rebellion already established the precedent of people rising against the king and deposing him and heirs while skipping to the top.

&gt;Stannis still offered forgiveness, plus a place of power at his side plus a place as heir in front of shireen, the only character he shows any care for. Renly laughed him off, of course, because he would be happy to murder his brother without any remotely fair offer of peace.

Further bull, seeing how Renly offers just as generous (if not more so when accounting his obvious advantages) terms if Stannis bends the knee to him.  In how he offers to give Stannis's SE if he wants it and so forth.  

Moreover, frankly Stannis's terms weren't all that generous as he basically offering Renly shit he already had.   Seeing how Renly already had SE and if he continues on his path he is king which is obviously better then just being a potential heir until Stannis has a son.

Of course he laughs him off seeing how without knowing about the shadow baby he has the obviously superior force.  Nor does he really consider Stannis's claim legitimate either thus legally he is unlawfully rebelling either way.  Finally, he has already crossed the Rubicon when he declared himself king so he cannot pull back from that without looking weak (especially to Stannis's inferior force) and betraying his allies deeply.  

Both Renly and Stannis were stubborn, but this argument that only Stannis offered the potential of peace with Renly refusing is absolutely incorrect.  Both offered terms for the other to bend and both refused to bend the knee.",1

The comment about the perineum being stretched only applies when no one is showing distress. There was another comment about the baby was not being in distress (from a medical student nonetheless), which is absolutely impossible to know without being there and looking at the FHM.

The doctor did not howver get full consent. He should have dressed up the full options, which he didn't, which might lead to successful litigation.

What the unions were fighting for in the early 1900's (labor laws, working hours, safety conditions, minimum wage), is now standard in federal law. If unions disappeared overnight, those laws would still be there. Unions are bloated beuracratic organizations and basing your presidential vote on their campaign contributing is naive.

"Just got out of a showing and I loved it! Not Marvel's best but definitely a worthy addition. It was a great experience but I did have a couple issues with it. 


-There was a few too many quips in the movie and some of them felt misplaced. It felt like when the action was really ramping up there would be a one liner and it would take me out of the moment

-Ultron was kind of whiny and not as menacing as he was made to seem. Too many jokes from him as well. Still better than most of Marvel's villains but that isn't saying much. 

-Hulk Buster fight ended abruptly. What happened in the end? Did Tony beat the Hulk into submission? Did Romanoff use another lullaby? Did SW's spell wear off and he came to his senses?

-Cap felt a little weak and a step down from TWS 

-Not sure this is a bad thing but the ending line! I was grinning from ear-to-ear in anticipation of hearing the line only to be blue balled.


Aside from that the movie was great and it was really funny in the end. Vision was kick ass and the twins were better than I was expecting them to be, I'd give it a solid 8/10.",1

There's no training course to where you get your sex license. And sex-ed does an absolute shit job of teaching people ANYTHING useful.

People do terrible things, and commit terrible acts all the time through a lack of knowledge. It's something anybody can fall prey to. If you don't think something like this could happen to you, had you been in his position, you're fooling yourself.

What's important is that once SOMEBODY had finally taught him, as obviously somebody desperately needed to, is that he realized his errors, and became self-reflective.

"&gt; It's life-altering and GIANT for any semblance of what these two people expected out of their present and future lives.

One was a black guy with no real future (post high school employment dealing weed and working at a porn store?). The BPD loathed and routinely locked up blacks in the 80s and 90s without probable cause as a means to prevent them from committing bigger crimes that would mean the BPD had to do actual work. Never mind the undocumented brutality that likely occurred without the current benefit of smart phones to record the violence. He could cooperate with the cops or end up tossed around in the paddy wagon (white van), his choice. 

The other was another loser who has amounted to a drug addict working as a manager at a dollar store (from the podcast). She smoked weed and hung out with criminals and supposedly knew that HML was buried in Leakin Park but didn't bother telling anyone for weeks until the cops stopped her in the street.

What has she done? All she does is give nebulous speeches about supporting education. Well guess what, the Taliban support education too, their name even means student. She isn't much more specific about it just so that no one can disagree with her without seeming like they oppose education. You see here her tactics work as I have been called a Taliban supporter just for opposing her. It's like calling anyone who criticises Israel a Nazi.

She was awarded the Nobel prize simply for being a celebrated victim, not for actually doing anything. Compare her to past peace prize winners, you have world leaders who actually ended wars with peace agreements. People complain Obama did nothing for his, he won because he pledged to reduce nuclear stockpiles and repair relations with the Muslim world. A hell of a lot more than Malala will ever accomplish. Then after he won the prize he ended multiple wars, killed Bin Laden and many other terrorists such as Al Awlaki, kept peace in dangerous situations where many called for war (Syria, Russia, etc), made peace with Cuba and isolated Iran (even Russia was sanctioning Iran) to the point where they agreed to some concessions on the nuclear issue.

What peace has she given us? Her ideology is damaging to real peace by disarming those who have the power and morals to enforce it. She is a lot like Jesus in that way. He could have saved the world, but instead he just wanted to be weak and die for no logical reason and thoughtless people love him for it.",1

I do really find it interesting how few older women are into all this. It seems to be almost exclusively popular with teens and women in their early 20s.

"When I was around 4 years old we took in a cat that previously resided in the barn. It was the runt of the litter that my pops got a soft spot in his heart for since it was getting picked on by the other cats. She had mites in her ears and she was pretty beat up, but we nursed her back to health and made her our pet.

Kitty.

We named her Kitty. My brother says that her real name is Amanda Blake, but she goes by Kitty.  

Like I said my father had a soft spot in his heart for this cat. Whenever he was making a sandwich he would cut a piece of Bologna, or cheese, any tiny piece morsel of anything he would give to the cat.  Braunschweiger was her favorite. Before it would even hit the ground that cat would devour that little flesh colored meat paste of deliciousness.  She soon turned on her hunter instincts and tracked down that same scent.  She found the another source of her treat.  She found the wrapper.

""What is wrong with the stupid cat."" My mother screams. 

By the time we woke up that next morning Kitty has forcefully dragged her bleeding ass over every square once of the carpet.  My pops worked third shift so he was just getting home and going to get into bed.  He lures the cat over and picked her up. 

""The wrapper is stuck in her butthole."" 

He calls my mom over as he is holding the cat facing him.  He is standing in the small bathroom in this beat up old farmhouse. His attire was no shirt and a pair of tighty whiteys.  My mother, armed with a Kleenex goes in for the kill. She grasps the small yellow rip cord and pulls it out in one fell swoop.

I have never seen a cats legs move that fast. It was as if Every once of my dads chest and face were mauled by this cat in mere seconds. It looked like a honey badger Rocky hybrid was unleashed in a butcher shop while being filmed by Quentin Tarentino.  The were pieces of flesh and fur flying in every direction as my four year old ears were introduced to an entirely new colorful language.

The next day we took Kitty to the vet to be declawed.

"&gt; As for the photos, they’ve been destroyed.

&gt; Is that legal? In Nevada, absolutely. UNLV associate law professor Sara Gordon said that in Nevada criminal cases anyone involved in a criminal case can apply for an order asking that exhibits be released or destroyed. ***If they are acquitted (and Floyd was) they can apply immediately afterward.***

So Floyd Mayweather was acquitted of criminal charges stemming from some evidence. Said evidence was destroyed. What's the problem? Was there some dereliction of justice *other* than the obviously-devious ""Floyd Mayweather was acquitted""? 

Jesus Christ, the ultra-liberal outrage machine has been punching in overtime to service all these pieces about how *awful* it is that someone was tried on a set of charges stemming from a multitude of incidents, and was acquitted on some counts and found guilty of a few others. 

How is the justice system ""supposed"" to work when Floyd Mayweather is involved? Summary execution? Will that shut these bungholes up? We should just execute Mayweather the next time he spits on the sidewalk, to save all these idiots the times spent pissing their pants. 

Fucking Christ I hate modern society. Are we still going to Mars?

You've lost all of the ""Monsters of the Midway"" in that time, and neglected to mention that.  You don't have the 2012 defensive personnel, most of them have retired or left to play for other teams, so your point is significantly compromised by not even recognizing that.

Who's on your defense that anyone has ever heard of?  Jared Allen who still hasn't proven his effectiveness in the last few years, and Kyle fuller, who still was too brief of a flash in the pan to have earned solid respect as a shutdown corner?  Antrell Rolle who has to try to adjust to a new team in the last years of his career?

You're trying to cite how potent your defense was when it was the ""Monsters of the Midway"", but they're gone now.  Now your defense is the ""Legion of Whom"", and drafting the 2nd best receiver that had a fluky fast 40 time at the combine doesn't help that defense at all.

For a while, and partially still ongoing today, an overall small but still significant segment of people on the internet decided that 'ethics in video games journalism' was worth getting media attention around and sending death threats over.

Of course you can care about video games! I play games. I play so many games. I care about games, in the same way I care about movies and books.

"""'That's My Job'

This meticulous tending to constituents began during Sanders' days as mayor of Burlington, a time when he rode snow plows to make sure streets were cleared after storms and even took calls from constituents in the middle of the night.

His close friend Richard Sugarman remembers when one resident woke Sanders up at 2 or 3 in the morning to report that someone had thrown a brick through the resident's window. Sugarman told Sanders that ""most mayors don't answer these kinds of calls."" Sugarman recalls his friend saying, ""That's my job, isn't it?""

You really shouldn't be worried, because he really cares. Bernie is Congress' longest-serving independent member in U.S. History. He's a grassroots statesmen who doesn't take money from billionaires or SuperPACS. In his home state of Vermont he is beloved, even amongst the conservative population in the state. Nobody organizes and attends more town halls and engages with more constituents than Bernie.

Mainly because I'd be feeling the burn on the lower/outer part of my humerus. But I didn't know this was wrong because I had almost no mind-muscle understanding of what it felt like to actually hit the short head of the biceps well.  Concentration curls helped me understand where the eff the short head was, so I knew regular curls were not hitting it.  Pre-exhausting brachialis and brachioradialis helped a lot.

&gt;My understanding is Biceps, Brachialis, &amp; Brachioradialis are all elbow flexors.

Yep, they all do elbow flexion, and the degree they contribute (I think) is largely dependent on supination/pronation of the hand.  

I believe the short head of the biceps is almost or totally responsible for supination so concentration curls can isolate it fairly well, but its hard to do a strict supination exercise.  So I figured pre-exhausting the brachialis and BRadialis would help, and it did.",1

When cases like this happen, they are absolutely tragic, there's no denying that. This shouldn't happen and a young girl did nothing to deserve this, but at the same time the fetus did nothing that deserves death. It's a very difficult issue, and I honestly do see it both ways. 

Pro-life, anti-abortion stance isn't (or at least shouldn't) be about punishing women at all. Sex isn't bad and children aren't bad, but lets not forget what sex is for. Sex is awesome, but it's biological purpose is reproduction, like that's what sex is supposed to result in. I think a lot of people see the pro-life stance and anti-women or anti-choice because children are such a commitment and can be nearly impossible to properly raise if you don't have the means to support them. 

 I really do hate how a lot pro-life is really more about pro-birth than anything else. I think that if you truly believe in the sanctity of life for every human being, that should extend to the mother and child after birth and beyond. You really can't have it both ways.

Of course this all changes if you do not believe that a fetus is fully human, or becomes human at a certain point in the pregnancy. I can see how people with that stance see it as something incredibly cruel to women. ",1

"... I think you missed my point entirely. Allow me to reiterate.

**""If we were all modders, there'd be no modding community.""**
This would cause an over-saturation of mods. Everybody would either be rallying to do exactly the same things, or nobody would because of the fact everybody can do what they want without looking elsewhere. We wouldn't need each other. That's even basic nature. Why go to you when I can do it just as well?

**""If everyone could mod, there'd be little to no need for a community, thus there'd be no Nexus, no Workshop, no ModDB.""**
This point is similar, but this is the RESULT of everyone being modders. Websites wouldn't be required as I could simply create a new sword if I wanted to. Or a new game mechanic. Or a new quest.

**""It's literally the principle of capitalism. No customers? No sellers.""**
Yup yup yup. If nobody has any need for any other modder, there's no need to spend money on websites, and things like dropbox would reign supreme. Simple file-hosting, or transfers through Skype calls for example, would be sufficient. This wouldn't be necessary either, as I could just make my own sword instead of looking for someone to make it for me.

If everyone was a modder, it WOULD be heaven, yes. But that's a utopia that cannot exist, as much as many of us would love it to be real. It's a dream to chase, for sure. But we have to remember individuals are different.

I cannot agree with you more on your learning point, though. Modding is a FANTASTIC way of learning proper game design, artistry, and fiddling around with lines of code.

But the thing is, we can't expect everyone to be modders. Be it motivation, other goals in life, or simply too busy to take up the task. So, the modding community needs each other. Modders, non-modders. We're a symbiotic relationship. And that's a good thing.

I mean don't get me wrong I'm not trying to cause an arguement or anything like that! I'm just saying why I believe mods should remain free. It's simply due to how modding is done, and how non-modders can provide benefits to the modders beyond simple money. And the fact that if everyone could mod, there's little need for sharing tips and tricks, because it assumes everyone has learned to use the proper tools and programs. Blender, SDK, that kind of stuff. It takes a long time to get that kind of technical skill.",1

His age = A (25)

Your age = B (15)

(20(A / 2 + 7 - B) / B)   /  10

Thus giving us the result of 6 / 10 on the ""wtf"" scale.

Since they also carry half of Sofia's DNA, that also makes them just as much hers. Equal ownership. 

So now we have a potentially landmark parental rights case that could set tons of precedent. They are both wealthy so there's no doubt in my mind that they will keep appealing it all the way up to the supreme court, even if all the higher courts just keep re-affirming the lower courts' judgement.

But because he has an emotional attachment to his crotch spawn (something we would consider normal in almost any other context), he is now creepy because people have decided he is just a jilted ex that specifically wants children with Sofia's DNA in them based on... no evidence.

I will root for the guy, but currently in the first round, these are the guys who I wouldn't trade Todd Gurley for straight up: Arik Armstead, Nelson Agholor, Cedric Ogbuehi, Shaq Thompson, Stephone Anthony, Damarious Randall, Melvin Gordon.

The only one of those who was drafted in the top half was Gordon. The two who went before 20 were a RB and a pure 3-4 end that we simply couldn't use.

"This is commonly cited as the situation in law firms, whereby associates are worked half to death, and in return, they receive a pseudo-retirement position with higher pay and less work when they move up.

First of all, law firm partners tend not to make millions of dollars a year. I'd challenge you to find one at that level who would admit she doesn't work nearly 70 hours a week or more.

Second of all, you have to factor in the fact that working huge hours while you're an associate forms a huge part of your training. There is a lot to learn and a lot to do. Being promoted to partner is not automatic these days. It's based on having proven your worth to the company, i.e. your potential, experience, dedication, and knowledge.

We see it as getting better towards the top because you tend to know what you're doing, and you have your own client base. Most partners have developed the trust of a number of clients whom they would probably take with them if they left the firm. This trust actually has a huge payoff for the firm, and from a marketability point of view, is something that a first-year associate lacks.

Now, you may say, fine, well that's just one type of business. I would posit that this applies to most if not all businesses. Does it really get easier at the top? I would imagine that you learn to not waste time on menial tasks, you become much better experienced and educated, and you bring other goods to the table.

In the army, for example, moving up to the top often means spending more and more time at your desk. I'll admit it seems quite contrary to common sense, but as Sun Tzu pointed out, wars are won before they are fought.

  If your biceps ""wont grow"" that just means you're weak and small.  Doing these sets, however well designed, is thus a waste of your time.  Until you can do 10 strict with 50 lbs on your waist, why curl anything?  By the time you get to that point, you'll be pleased with how your arms look.  

I never got why chins are called a back exercise.  It's the same motion as a curl, and you're using huge slabs of muscle in back to help make it happen...yet it's way more difficult.  Why is this?  Because to a large degree you're lifting your whole body with a small, weak muscle.  If it really were just a back exercise, it would be easy, but only 1 in 10 people can do a single.  You cannot stimulate the biceps more than you can with a chinup.

"jRPG isn't a genre, it's a regional term. 

---    
  
**Vita** 

--- 
  
**Ys: Memories of Celceta** - A great Action RPG with a memorable cast of characters, fun gameplay, good story, and a nice soundtrack to go along with it.      
**Demon Gaze** - A newbie friendly First Person Dungeon-Crawler, for new people who are interested to get into the genre Demon Gaze is the go to choice on the Vita.   
**Persona 4: Golden** - The most recommended game on the Vita. Persona 4 is a turn-based RPG with dating sim elements. Within the game you will be tasked to decide if you will want to spend your time getting to know people (which does benefit you in the long run), help increase your dating sim stats, or focus at trying to solve the supernatural mystery that the town your character has moved into has been plagued with. It's a very anime-ish game, and some people might find the anime troupes to be overbearing or how happy and bright the game is, but the graphics and soundtrack are pretty great.      

---

**PSP**     

--- 


**Legend of Heroes: Trails in the Sky First Chapter** - A turn-based RPG with Strategy RPG-esque battles. The Trails series is known for being story heavy RPGs and are praised for it. The character development is fantastic, the music is pretty amazing too, overall the game is amazing. First part of a trilogy, the second part is due sometime later this year.    
**Persona 3: Portable** - A port of Persona 3 for the PS2. If you find that Persona 4 is to happy then Persona 3 is the game for you. The game has been notched down from the PS2, but overall it's still the Persona 3 that people know and love. Persona 3 Portable takes more a visual novel approach due to the PSP limitations than a standard RPG. Usually a love it or hate it port from what I've seen. I prefer the Persona 3:FES version which is just an enhanced re-release of the original Persona 3 which means it plays like a standard turn-based RPG, but people love being able to control the whole party even.     
**Ys series** - The whole series I is great and should be played. 7 and Memories of Celceta play similarly. Oath in Felghana plays more like a faster and actiong paced Zelda titled, and Ys Chronicles plays a lot like an early Action-RPG.        
one of the best console Action-RPGs ever made.   
**Yggdra Union** - A enhanced port of the  GBA game. Basically it's a Fire Emblem/Advance War clone, but don't let the word clone scare you it's an amazing game in it's own right.   
**Phantom Brave: The Hermuda Triangle**: A great Strategy RPG that I didn't find punishing. These are the same developers that made the Disgaea games that I'm not really that fond of because I'm not really that great at Strategy games, but I love Phantom Brave, I didn't find the difficulty at all to be troubling and the story was really heartwarming. The one feature that makes this game stand out is that the main female protagonist can turn objects into party members around her. It's a really great feature so you don't have to worry about your units dying and not having reinforcements.
Valkyrie Profile Lenneth &amp; Lunar: Silver Star Harmony are both enhanced ports of cult classic games. I haven't played any of their variations so I can't say but you should definitely consider these.

Final Fantasy V  - One of my favorites Final Fantasy titles are one of my favorite turn-based RPGs in general. I really love how simple and lighthearted the story is. But one thing that sets this apart is the job system. While you don't get to create you're character you do get to pick what classes they are, and ontop of that you can pick what subclass they are too. So for example you can create a Warrior with black mage spells, or a Thief with time mage abilities.  
Final Fantasy VII   - A very very accesible turn-based RPG. While some people might not like the story, what FF7 does it does very well. I never found a something that FF7 did bad at all   
Final Fantasy IX  - A throwback to the classic Final Fantasy games. It's lighthearted at parts and serious in others. Overall one of my favorite FF games along with 7.  
Wild Arms - A very early Playstation 1 RPG, to many people it feels like any other SNES RPG except in 3D
Xenogears - A cult classic RPG that focuses on Religion. Disc 1 is fantastic while Disc 2 less so due to Square taking budget from Xenogears and putting it in FF8. Combat is great, sprite work is fantastic, overall the game is a unique experience that none of the spiritual successors have been able to mimic.  
Legend of Dragoon - A unique turn-based RPG. Instead of just pressing attack and watching the attack animation, through a series of QTEs you're actually performing them. Story has been criticized, but I never found it to be as bad as some people make it out to be.

"Firstly there are limitations on how much the government can raise in taxation. If taxes are too high the economy shrinks and revenue falls. There's a sweet spot where revenue is at its peak. See the Laffer curve.

Second, money printing forces up the yield on bonds. Increased bond yields means domestic interest rates rise. Increased interest rates means falling house prices. If house prices fall banks must raise capital. To raise capital banks must stop lending. If banks stop lending we get a massive deflationary spiral. This would be good for the overall economy in the long term, but it would also mean government revenues fall. When revenues fall the government will need to cut more or borrow more.

Overall it's a good idea for the government to balance the books.

"&gt;575 is still pretty decent and will give you range over nearly everyone

575 is effectively no different from 500, 550, or 600 when it come to trading with champions.  Even an Urgot without boots can get into range of a 575 AA-range champion within half a second to trade back (remember that Annie has a roughly half-second windup on her autoattack animation), which means that they'd go even on the amount of autoattacks traded if the Urgot wants to shoot back.  

This nerf is designed to completely destroy Annie's ability to poke without expending mana, which is one of the biggest ways a good Annie player gathers a lead (i.e. one of the biggest reasons anyone ever picks her over a different champion).  If Riot takes this away from her, then all Annie will have left to her core identity will be the one-shot Tibberdunk which is the main thing people seem to hate about playing against her.",1

"This guy isn't a pedo, but certainly a creep or weird at minimum. It's not about him being attracted to the young (pedo) but it's either seeking a relationship where he has more power or him not having options in his more socially appropriate age bracket, possibly for good reason. 

If you figure on the fairly normative curve for being socially appropriate of half the age of the older person plus 7 years, but the better metric for that might be environment. It would be weird for a high school student to date a middle school student, and there's even a huge gap between an undergrad and a recent grad for world experience and social pull. It's weird, or would at least look weird to outsiders wether or not skepticism is warranted for valuable social reasons, society occasionally makes crappy mass judgements, but we tend to let the wiser ones blend into the background. It's good that you seem skeptical. 

Best case scenario is still sad. If he's working with teens he may feel like he lacks attainment to approach people closer to his age. He might be giving up. Clearly he is sociable enough and may just lack confidence, getting involved with this guy isn't going to help him not have further social problems. 

The last, and most disturbing, and frankly most likely way to look at this situation is to consider that he buys beer for underaged girls who has some serious flaws or issues that keep him from advancing his career and is clearly flaunting what he clearly knows are social taboos. This is a guy you should stay away from, who doesn't suspect societal norms, may consider himself a failed man, and may have obvious issues that cause others to distrust him, and clearly you don't fully or you wouldn't be here. You should tell someone else what's been going on and back up your texts as insurance, and let him know that this isn't going to happen. Feel free to do it gently and be real, tell him that you're both in totally different phases of life and he should meet people he has more naturally in common with and would be happier doing so, but it's wise to entertain the possibility that he's a creep.

We gotta hope Norwood takes his solid next step forward to being a active productive WR every game for us, hopefully Matthews steps up and can make the team and produce, hopefully we draft Lockett or my favorite Chris Conley and hopefully in their rookie season right out of the gate they are productive and threats. Why? If the Rams D-line is shutting down our run, we gotta pass...great to have Graham but we know just Baldwin &amp; Kearse &amp; Lockette aren't enough. Need more talent at WR for Russ. Also need an explosive return game on ST. 

Niners: Eh. From the sounds of it he is a project guy that didnt produce many stats in College and was projected for the 2nd or 3rd round? I still think the 9ers are a dumpster fire and unless Kaep takes huge leaps and bounds forward they will be lucky to be 8-8. If they grab DGB then color me a little more worried than i am currently. 

Cards and Humphreys: Damn good O-lineman. Just makes it all the harder to get pressure and sack Carson Palmer which will be key because with Palmer healthy they will be really good. Just means Marsh will have to really step up and produce, Mebane will be needed healthy and not dropping off in production, basically our pass rush has to be on point...no starting slow with no sacks like last season. Need our 2013 pass rush back. ",1

The brand split is, by WWE's own admittance, one of the worst things they've ever done. It alienated casual audience, caused major problems with talent (wrestlers and commentators), was hated by higher ups and agents, and ultimately precipitated a decline in a viewers that the company blames entirely on the split. 

The draft always did awful ratings, USA network hated the split and repeatedly asked them to end it, and it actually weakened their bargaining power with NBCU. The end of the split has lead to an overall increase in viewers which the company views as being caused by the end of the split. Let's not forget how much the split fucked up title prestige, leading to those much lauded leather and gold straps to be worthless props (which they are, but they shouldn't feel like it).

"It would be fine if it was the actual musicians.  Rather, it's the *recording industry* that's trying to profit here, and the service they provide is much less useful and economically viable than it once was.

Consider: when it was hard to make a CD or a record, they were doing something really valuable with their mass duplication services.  Paying the actual artists was something they had to be dragged, kicking and screaming, into.... and they only did it because they had to, because it was the cost center to make their plastic disks interesting to consumers.  ( And they still routinely cheat artists, absolutely routinely.)

Well, guess what?  In 2015, everyone with a computer has an entire music factory, sitting under their desks.  The act of making a copy of music for someone, the thing the RIAA has been getting wealthy on for decades, is now *worthless*.  Creating the master copy of the CD is worth something, but making a copy of it?  That has no value.  Anyone can do that.  Their big problem is this: that's the service they're selling.

All this legal carrying on is trying to preserve a business model that doesn't work anymore.  They are not providing a valuable service in the modern world.  Making a copy of music for you is worth nearly nothing -- which is why you can find so many places that will do it for free, running off simple ad revenue.

When that failed, he momentarily took off running, until Officer Wilson stepped out of his car and told him to stop.  At that point, he spun around and charged the officer like a football player, and was justifiably shot.  The case had almost nothing to do with men's rights, except that Officer Wilson very narrowly escaped becoming another man killed on the job.

"&gt;I need clarification that it is all strictly a psychological hallucination, nothing more. I can not associate with any form of occult ritual or something related to that, because I resent it. 

Personally, I would absolutely love it if I tried out something like this and it turned out to be occult or supernatural.  A whole new world to explore, whole new possibilities, new avenues of knowledge to explore!

Unfortunately it's (occult is) all fairy tales and bullshit, but that's an argument for a different day.

Tulpas are what you make of them, it can be occult, it can be purely psychological.

&gt;If it's entirely in your mind, how can it be ""sentient"" with it's own thoughts and personality?

Good question.  I personally say that isn't true at all.  The tulpa isn't separately sentient from you, and isn't separate from your own personality in terms of the fundamental assumptions and biases that make up you.

It is different in your distinguishing your thoughts as arriving from you or from an external place.  Think of it less ""alien voice in my head"" and more ""learning to shift how I think"".

&gt;How can it control you if it's all in your head? It seems very fishy to me.

How can you control you if you are all in your head?  I have my doubts about switching as well, but I can't really say much about it beyond that.

&gt;Is there any other spiritual or otherwise ritualistic background to it?

It's called tulpas because it originated due to a metaphysical/Tibetan practice.  It's since been twisted and rearranged into an easily digestible and usable culture.  In the true American way!

&gt;I'm intrigued, but skeptical.

I suspect your question was more about whether or not I consider being LGBT specifically to be a sin.  No, I don't consider being strongly tempted towards a particular sin to be a sin in and of itself.  It is the actual action which would be a sin.  

If the question is about the action, I lean towards LGB sexual activity as being a sin as it seems the most straightforward interpretation, but I have also seen plenty of good arguments claiming the prohibitions against homosexual activity in the Bible were more about opposing pagan cultural practices.  Ultimately, i'd lean towards applying the ""meat sacrificed to idols"" test here. 

As far as transexuality/transgenderism, i'm not sure the Bible really says anything about it one way or another.

In which case, while the driver would be a horrible piece of shit, we would still hold the woman accountable because she ran in front of the car (assuming we could prove this). The way your analogy worked, is that the woman never actually chose to get hit by the car but rather put herself in a position where she could be hit. However, in the case of drunk consent - she CHOOSES to have sex (albeit inebriated).

Wolves Den wasn't.  But Wolves Den failing is just proof of how bad the PvP is in this game.  Of how ridiculous CC is.  Of how poorly implemented this category of gameplay that Yoshi-p claims to love is.  

I hear that PvP is way more popular in Japan than it is over here.  I don't know why.  I guess because Japan hasn't really experienced good MMO PvP.

Like I said, I enjoy XIV, and PvP is by far my favorite things to do on MMOs, but it's never going to get better if people don't just stop accepting what we got and push for better, more involved and skillful PvP.",1

"An innocent Adnan and innocent Jay(as in not a murder/not hanging with the murderer) could very well have gone to see Adnan around 3ish. They hung out someplace near school probably smoking weed. Adnan called Nisha who wasn't home yet. Jay dropped Adnan back to track and drove around until he picked Adnan up. Whatever else they did that night is anyone's guess, but it didn't include burying a body. When Hae's body was found, Jay started to believe Adnan tried to frame him and started telling stories to cover his own behind. Remember how he told, was it Chris, the murder happened at the library? It might have been the only place Jay could think of Adnan committing the crime since he was at school the whole time as far as Jay knew. When the cops catch up to Jenn, they both think they are getting charged with Hae's murder. If you questioned their fear of police before, check out the Southwest precinct's ""flex squads"" in the Baltimore Sun and David Simon's recent interviews (if the riots don't speak for themselves). Jay decides to throw himself under the bus as an accessory once Jenn tells the cops about parts of the made up story Jay had been telling friends about seeing Hae's body and being present for her burial. He takes the risk for himself and Jenn. Having inside knowledge of the crime from someone who knew the actual killer or his partner helped fill in some gaps the cops were looking for including the car's location. The cops did the rest by avoiding/ignoring bad evidence. Of course this is pure speculation.

"The Avengers is my favorite movie of all time. I went into it completey blind. Didn't follow any of the hype, hadn't seen a superhero movie since Iron Man, and wasn't even planning on seeing it until a friend suggested we go. I don't know why, but it struck a chord with me. I loved every second of it. I felt like a kid watching the whole thing. I had a great experience and I just wanted more and more.

I had an insanely good time, so good that for awhile I was nearly obsessed with the MCU. I followed all the news I could, got hyped for every movie, every TV show, every one-shot. I waited pretty much impatiently for three years for Age of Ultron to come out. Sometimes it felt impossible, sometimes I totally forgot it was a thing. Near the end of the wait the hype started deflating. Maybe Marvel Movies aren't that cool, maybe I should grow up and start watching more adult movies and getting excited for those rather than salivating over the next Avengers film, maybe I should pay more attention to my real life. Then the reviews came in, everyone saying ""oh it's getting bad reviews, it's only at a 70 on Rotten Tomatoes"". The hype just kept going down. Getting myself entangled in the online superhero community was taking its toll.

But it's been a long three years, and I finally got to see Age of Ultron today, opening day. And I fucking LOVED it. It was exactly what I wanted. More character interaction, more team effort, more works building, more jokes, the list goes on. I had an amazing time. This literally felt like a continuation of my favorite movie of all time. Not just a cash in sequel, a continuation.

Did it have flaws? Of course. The original had flaws too. This one had some as well. The pacing was off in parts, Ultron wasn't the intimidating villain we were all promised, the scale was a bit smaller than I wanted, some of the world building was forced and I felt killing Quicksilver was a cop out move just to say ""oh someone actually died this time.""

But everything else was just fantastic. I had an amazing time. I'm so happy to have finally seen it. It was just straight up awesome. I get some people may not like it, some people may not be into superhero movies and others may have gotten themselves overhyped, but it was insane. 10/10 on the fun factor for me. Maybe 9/10 as an actual movie. 

I loved it.",1

you going to court for shoplifting and facing the consequences... is that going to help anyone's career? it's not. so there's no motivation to screw you over. just keep it that way. if you're a jerk to the cops, you may create motivation.

* The wood texturing towards the middle-left of the image gives a much better impression of depth. The rest of the paneling seems about the same, which makes me believe the difference is mostly due to relighting (see below).

* Clothes are on par, that's pretty clear. They've redone the waistcoat texture but the overall look is pretty similar. I'd even say there's a smidge more texture resolution in the sleeves of the top image.

* Lighting in the bottom image is flashy, but ultimately annoying. The stark shadows and bright lighting were probably difficult to manage for the cinematic artists, so they went for a more subdued lighting instead. The bottom image also appears to be using a starker tone mapping (higher contrast, slight desaturation), which is a common technique to make images more striking, even though they're not any higher fidelity.

* Looking at the hair on two monitors to try and see, it looks virtually identical.

Bale started and somewhat madr his name as a left-back (taxi for Maicon), and has played his best football as a left winger and right winger. He has the knowledge and reading of the game as a full-back with the talent of a pacey winger, surely that is the pefect blend for a Van Gaal wing-back, rather than Young/Valencia? The only other players in that mold are perhaps Baines, Alaba, Marcelo, etc (versatile, attacking full-backs). It's just that Bale plays in a RM system that is so attacking that people have forgotten that he was predominantly a left back for most of his career.

I don't imagine he'd play him through the middle as it's pretty star-studded there. ",1

2.) Trade = Gauranteed choice of WR + loss of this year's first round pick

How does getting your favorite of 3 amazing WRs = losing the potential of a first round draft pick?! In what world are the players in the first round so bad that you'd rather have Sammy than the other two players and not even have a chance to see what one of these first rounders can do?

You could argue the trade isn't as bad as it could've been, but it certainly wasn't ""good.""

What he is doing is being pragmatic and this sub reddit is having a complete shit fit just because Sanders doesn't go all the way. If you people realized what he is doing then you'd be supporting this guy instead of forming a lynch mob against. But I guess I'll need to explain it, first off yes, Bernie is for unionization, yes he is for fighting racial and income inequality and finally he is also for cooperative. So please ppl, please tell me why in hell we should ban discussion of Sanders when he is the closest we have ever had of achieving a socialist state of the U.S.

I just read about Sanders, he actually boycotted and opposed the Israeli PM back on March 23rd, 2015 so the fact that the PSA states Bernie is a Zionist is an outright lie and just pisses me off more that somehow discussion or support of Sanders should be banned even though hes one of us guys, ONE of US!!

"You really do not understand how to interpret those very simple pieces of information.  The 50% of environmental water usage represents water that simply cannot be extracted from the environment for human use, for whatever reason.  So while interesting, it's not particularly useful information when thinking about where to focus efforts on mitigating the impacts of this megadrought.  If you throw away that number and focus on the remaining water that IS available for human use, then urban (including lawns because that's not agriculture) use takes up 20% to agriculture's 80%. 

Now it would be even more useful to break down that 80% among different sectors of agriculture such as staple food crops, vs livestock and the crops grown to feed them, vs non-food crops, etc.  If you do this, you will unfortunately see that the meat industry utilizes an inordinate amount of water when compared to the calories that a kilogram of meat protein provides vs non-meat caloric sources.  I say unfortunately because I am a dedicated carnivore and feeling more and more guilty about that fact every day due to the impact the meat industry has on the environment and precious natural resources such as water.

anyway....  I wanted to start with the fact that actual DRINKING water, whether it be from the faucet or bottled...  is wildly insignificant and an almost negligible amount compared to the total amount of water used by humans.  

the most effective thing people could do to use less water would actually be to eat less meat.  talking about restaurants not giving you a glass of water automatically or bottled water is just....  a waste of attention.",1

also, via wikipedia

Progressivism is a broad philosophy based on the Idea of Progress, which asserts that advancement in science, technology, economic development, and social organization are vital to improve the human condition. 

Conservatism as a political and social philosophy promotes retaining traditional social institutions in the context of the culture and civilization. Some conservatives seek to preserve things as they are, emphasizing stability and continuity, while others, called reactionaries, oppose modernism and seek a return to ""the way things were""

"What you described is criminal behavior by police. However, the very reason that an abusive cop would do something like that is because it is nearly impossible to prove and easily excused (that he swerved due to ice or something). 

That doesn't make any of it excusable, but there is no point in talking about it because you can't solve it without putting cameras in every car's interior and every cell's interior. Then what happens when the camera goes off suddenly? Did the cop purposefully damage the camera to commit his crime? Or did the camera go out on its own? 

See how it becomes problematic? In the end the cameras can only cause good cops who didn't shut off the camera but had the unfortunate rare incident of something on camera making him look guiltier than he really is, and will still allow the bad cop who knows he's about to commit something horrible to get away with it in many ways and nothing changes.

So what's the solution for abusive cops? There really isn't any. There will always be a minority of cops that will do terrible things with their authority. You can hope to minimize it by improving training, improving reporting to IA, etc.

And the child support isn't a punishment. It's not to hurt one parent and reward the other for being cunning. It's for the *child*. It's literally in the name. If a child of yours exists, you need to support it. It doesn't matter if the mother is straight out of hell.

But, I've seen too many people coming through here, spewing out a lot of noise that clouds issues for beginners that could have easily been less murky.  Most of those people are looking for validation to justify the training they've been doing and to fluff their ego.

Maybe, best case scenario, you've got some nerdy completionists tendencies.  That's what you dragged out something simple and straight forward into an unnecessary wall of text.  Even then, this is still a cautionary tale in the dangers of spreading a little bit of knowledge too far.

The 15 pound dumbbell bit is bullshit.  Plain and simple.  It's wrong.  If you want to grow your bicep with concentration curls, you need to increase your training stimulus.  The simplest, most effective way for beginners to increase the reps, then increase the weight once they're hitting the reps.  This dumb circlejerk about perfect form with light weight is very literally counterproductive to strength training.  

Supination is not necessary.  It gave you a fun little literary device to tease out.  I get the impression that trying to be entertaining is getting in the way of disseminating good information.  But, on the other hand, it will get you upvotes from entertained people.  

The superset is unnecessary.  No one needs a bicep circuit.  This is absolutely is an arbitrary superset.

"So, look. You're not wrong, but you're sacrificing his well-being to be right. It sounds like he may have actually really needed you, and he made himself vulnerable to you, even when he was *mad* at you, which says a lot about how he values you. He may have even been trying to extend an olive branch, to be with you, close to you, to help move past the fight. You may need physical distance when fighting, but a lot of men show care through physical intimacy, because verbal expression does not always come easily. Removing yourself from his presence may have left him feeling completely unable to do anything to fix it. 

In my marriage, though we try not to go to bed angry, it doesn't always work. But during the night, we always find our way back to each other. I'm not good with feelings, and I get angry when I feel disrespected, and sometimes I dig in my heels when I think I'm right. But at night, when I wake up anxious and unhappy because of our fight, but I find we are holding hands in our sleep, I remember what life felt like when we were briefly separated, and how I promised I would never let my ego get in the way again. And imagining that makes the anger go away. 

If being together means more than being right, apologize for not being there for him when he was down. Understand that he probably picked a fight with you to hear you say you valued him, respected him, and that you were a safe space when the rest of the world seemed shitty. It's not right, and he needs to work on communicating what he needs more productively, but I bet that is what he really wanted. Instead, you called him a pussy (poor timing for that joke), making him question if you respected him, then you ignored him to go talk to another attractive man. 

Let me repeat, you are *not* wrong, but he was feeling low, and you missed a chance to support him. If you want to invest in the long term, tell him you're sorry you didn't support him better. Acknowledge your care for him and concern for his happiness. Reiterate that you were not flirting with your friend, that you aren't interested in another person, but that you don't appreciate his jealous reaction. Follow up by saying you understand a lot of this was due to stress, miscommunication and bad timing, and apologize for your part in that. Ask him to try to communicate his frustrations more productively in the future. Ask him if he's still feeling stressed out and unhappy and see if he wants to talk more. Remind him you love him and his happiness is important to you. 

You can dig a trench and stay there till he realizes how wrong he was, or you can lead by example and show him how to resolve conflict in a healthy productive way. If he refuses to take your lead, then you can assess your relationship again. But stop worrying who is right or wrong and focus instead on how to build the foundation so these arguments don't happen anymore in the future. It takes effort to have a healthy relationship, but it's so worth it. ",1

This is just my opinion, I know I got off topic but Hitch has turned our organization around, going from not qualifying for playoffs to consistent Division and Conference Champions.

"&gt;  jak and Daxter

Can I be that guy?

I played those games last year (bought the collection on the PS3), and I honestly don't know what people see on them. The first one was a generic collectathon (which isn't bad, but also not particularly impressive), with FUCKING DAXTER FUCK THAT GUY seriously I hated the fact that your ""friend""'s sole fuction was to mock you and be a nuisance throughout all the game.

I can deal with annoying characters if it's shown they don't mean to be obnoxious, but Daxter was past merely 'antagonizing'. He was outright mean, constantly berating the silent Jak, who was supposedly his friend. For a 'buddy' platformer they didn't act like buds at all.

Then comes the second game, which could just as well be called Jak &amp; Daxter 2: The One Where We Hired An Emo Writer

Hey, imagine Crash Bandicoot. Done? Now imagine a game where Cortex captures him, tortures him for two years until he's got PSTD, he begins speaking, swearing to ""MURDER CORTEX FOR WHAT HE'S DONE TO ME"", and grows a *fucking* ***goatee***, just to drive the point home.

Oh, and now he has a 'dark side', driven by his anger, and he can't control it and yadda yadda darkfic 101.

Ah, also, you get a totally gnarly hoverboard. Tubular.

Also, his games are now story-driven third person shooters, instead of platformers.

Also, add a huge, sprawling GTA-like city, only there is absolutely nothing to do anywhere, and 'cops' are easily avoidable, plus they don't care if you steal cars. So the only purpose you have in it is driving for minutes at a time from mission to mission. And then from mission to objective.

While adding stuff in, don't forget the escort mission! Oh yes, do you feel like shooting creepers that slowly make their way toward two old men moving slowly through an open field? No? Great! Because you're shooting creepers that **quickly** make their way toward two old men moving slowly through an open field. Make sure this mission is near the climax of the game and frustratingly hard as well, just so you lose interest in arguibly the only interesting part of the plot.

I finished Jak 2 to see if 3 would be redeemable. It was Jak 3: More Of Jak 2

EDIT:

Oh! OH! How could I forget? The unlockables! Yes, my friend, by the small price of **killing all enemies in the game** at least once (killing the same enemy twice won't give you their core, which you need to purchase the unlockable), you can get new Dark Jak powers! I know, so, you already have that power that kills all enemies on the screen and turns you back to normal, so you'll get... another power kills all enemies on the screen and turns you back to normal. And a third one after that.

I mean, I *think* the second and third ones are more powerful, but since *you already kill all enemies on the screen*, then what's the point?

Oh, speaking of that, the last boss? If you turn into Dark Jak and die, you lose the meter. Don't worry though, you can refill the meter if you just *die three more times*.

I'm not saying you can't kill the boss without it, I'm saying using the dark power takes away half his health so why would you bother chiping away conventionaly.",1

"There is no such thing as a ""same sex marriage"" in the eyes of God, and therefor in the eyes of the Church. It's just a mockery of a real marriage. Similarly a ""polygamous marriage,"" a ""green-card marriage,"" or an ""open marriage"" are all make-believe. Such things are not marriages the Church recognizes because they lack the core substance of a real marriage.

Sexual relations outside of a Real Marriage are gravely sinful, hetero-, homo- or whatever. It doesn't matter.

As to objecting to the government creating ""civil marriage"" for same-sex couples, the Church objects on many grounds. Likewise the Church objects to divorce and remarriage under civil authority. The narrative that the Church is ""picking on gays,"" is just another in a long series of lies.

Furthermore, you don't need to be religious to have serious reservations against the idea of government ""same-sex marriages."" It's a brazen violation of the 14th Amendment under Equal Protection to hand out privileges (in this case special accommodations under insurance, tax, and estate laws) to a particular partnership (in this case a sexual union) without the law presenting a Rational Basis under which such an institution provides a unique benefit to the Public Interest that other partnerships (business, platonic, or familial) do not. 

The elephant in the room is that if Real Marriage does not meet the generative interest original put forth in privileging said marriages, the only remedy permitted under the U.S. Constitution is for the government to get out of the marriage business entirely. There is no valid provision to -expand- the violation by adding same-sex ""marriages"" while still barring everyone who wants those privileges and doesn't want to involve sexual congress - the business partners, the life-long friends, the siblings, etc. The Public Interest in promoting homosexual sexual unions over all those other kinds of partnerships is exactly -nothing-. It's a private affair that's nobody's business but their own.",1

"&gt;There is something called the 5th Amendment. At least in a court of law we are not allowed to infer anything from a refusal to speak. I will extend that courtesy here. 


The fifth amendment says you're not required to incriminate yourself. This is quite a ways apart from dispelling a misunderstanding someone might have to your character after you said that cheating on someone is rape in your book, but then proceeded to cheat on your boyfriend with *five* other people. Or the thing where you said you murdered someone (not in reference to your participation in Helldump though, since their claim that they drove a person to suicide is a separate issue and claim.) Or the thing where you lied about being raided by a website for 30 year old male virgins who are disenfranchised with society gather to commiserate- because two screen caps off an anonymous message board don't constitute ""evidence"" as opposed to things like page hits, emails, or simple phone records. Or the time you lied about TFYC's being transphobic. They have no issue with trans people- they just wanted people to confirm their genders by a deadline because their project *was* about helping women. 



Usually you'd think that someone would be in a *rush* to dispel such a thing. Instead whether or not Quinn slept around has been the one thing she's consistently not spoken about directly. It happened in the same sense that we know gravity is there even if we can't physically *see* gravity. 



&gt;Telling someone something is off the record than reporting it is unethical. If that happened it is wrong. However speaking off the record would probably still violate court order.


That'd come down to the fine text of the court order. Eron claims to have not been violating it, and not intending to violate it, and was speaking with the impression that this was all off the record. I guess we'll have to see what is actually done on the legal level to see who's full of shit.

I do feel sorry for non-blacks living in the Baltimore area, but they should look at the riots as a signal to get the fuck out of there.

For starters, the interior. Heated leather automatic electronic cooled touch screen activated everything, most guys don't want to do a crazy overhaul on their interior and if you have money to burn (this is a hypothetical dream build after all) why not get the one with the fanciest interior?

Then there's the fact that the Rubicon trim level comes with a bunch of required off road kit. Lockers, heavy duty axles, and an electronic disconnecting sway bar to name a few... these are all features that any self respecting modern off roader would have. So, you could buy a Sahara or well equipped Sport for like $35K then spend 20 grand (or better) on axle swaps, gear swaps, skid plates, locking differentials, etc, voiding warranty, or you could just buy a stock Rubicon for $45K that comes with all that gear from the factory. In the long run it's just cheaper to buy the Rubicon if you plan on doing a serious build.

"I can see how that could easily go. People often rate for enjoyment. When you're at the end of that show you can be like ""Aw it's over? That's how they end it? Oh well, I guess it was good throughout the season. 7... or maybe an 8"" but then you go back and think about it a little ""Hmm why did I give it a 7 again? Yeah I liked the char... wait I didn't like the characters, they were all douchebags. There must have been one... Aoyama? And fuck the whole thing was frustrating. Fuck! Why did I like it again? ... I can't come up with anything. Now that I remember it was a terrible show, fuck! It's not even a 6, the whole thing was so shitty... more like a 4!""

I wouldn't count that as overanalysing. It's just that when the art and the characters are pretty you can forget and forgive a show for many things without realizing. Once this guy remembered the show was bad and there weren't more episodes or cute art to keep him distracted he gave it a more honest personal score.

Dumb typo mistakes from my mind has moved on but the fingers are left to finish up the words.  Last night I get maybe 3-4 hours sleep.  Waking up kind of sucks, but when I first wake up, the brain fog lifts right away.  The next today (today) I'll go to bed earlier.  That means I'll wake up in the middle of night.  Once awake, wide awake.  But I know to wait and eventually fall asleep again or my sleep schedule is even further off.  Since I got more sleep, I can stay up a long time the next day.  And then on the weekends I'm ending up staying in bed, dozing or sleeping until the afternoon or evening.   

Memory consolidation I still wonder about.  Am I not remembering as much if I sleep less?  Is my brain processing everything faster than normal, and it just doesn't need any extra time?

"When I was a youngster until I was I was in my teens, I had the same recurring figure. Not the same dream, always ended differently with different events but always started with the same figure. Let me paint the picture here first. My bedroom window looked out on to a culdersac at the top of a very steep hill. It was lit by one street lamp. If you looked out into it at night, culdersac would be lit but it's entry would plunge off into oblivion. So from my window every night, I could see what looked like (to me) the poster from The Exorcist.

Now, the dream would always start the same. I'd be sleeping, and wake up to the faint incoming tune from beyond the hill. I would hear this tune grow as the figure of my nightmares would make it's way, lumbering up the hill. The tune was some sort of low double bass Looney Tunes or Tom &amp; Jerry number I can never find the name of. The figure? Sweetums from The Muppets. He would dance/lumber up into the light of the culdersac and I would immediately try to hide under the covers or bed or in the closet, nothing ever worked. I'd always hear him coming into the house and then down the hallway, into my room where he would proceed to violently fling me against shit until I was broken and laid their bleeding before finally putting me out of my misery and crushing my head. Often either with his foot, something nearby or by just biting down.

Over the years the dream varied as I learned to run and hide and escape into different areas of the house but everything always ended the same. One of the most messed up scenarios once was when he had two dogs, big white wolves actually. He sicked them on me and that went just swimmingly. Another time he possessed my family and turned them all into red eyed catatonics who if I approached them they'd open their mouths wide as a snakes and reveal their teeth and tongue (looked like the mouth of a freaking deep sea angler fish), horrifying.

The last time I dreamed about Sweetums though was the most interesting...

The dream started the same way it always did. The impending music, Sweetums lumbering into the light of the culdersac, but this time I didn't hide. I didn't even leave my room. In fact I just sat there, waiting, watching the door for Sweetums. And as the music got to it's usual loud state with his proximity he stopped in the door way and just stared at me. Me at him and him back at me. For the first time ever he spoke, in my Dad's voice... ""Well done. I'm proud of you."" Then he walked away.

I've never seen him since... 7 years of recurring nightmares at it ends with that.",0

"&gt;Please stop perpetuating the myth that acceleration, rotation, or curvilinear coordinates mean you have to bring in general relativity. 

Maybe this is semantics, but I think such a strong distinction is unnecessary. GR subsumes and includes everything SR contains and makes no distinction where a connection comes from, the formalism is identical. Curvature is curvature in the math even if it is sourced by proper acceleration. The concept of *generalized* relativity which includes all aspects of relativity is a perspective I've heard from other physicists many times.

For example, a frame with constant acceleration the curvature induces a nonzero vacuum expectation value and you get thermal radiation. All of this occurs on what is otherwise a true flat background and is intimately related to Hawking Radiation.",0

"As someone who just installed an AppRadio 4 (as in literally just installed it yesterday), I think it's probably a little premature to jump in. 


I'm happy with the AppRadio, but I was coming from a factory radio with no Bluetooth or any other features.


I think it's too early to tell if the glitches are Pioneer/Alpine issues or if it's on Apple's end. I have little respect for the software development skills of either Pioneer or Alpine, so I'm inclined to point the finger at them. Once OEMs start installing Carplay we should have a better idea.


Speaking of OEMs, once we see Carplay in factory systems I think Carplay will start to offer more apps and features. I don't know how Carplay apps are added to existing apps or are vetted by the App store, but they're being added at a snail's pace. Based on the lack of Carplay units on the road, it's hard to blame app developers for not making their apps Carplay compatible.


Unless you have a need (I need Bluetooth for hands free), I would suggest holding off for a few months to see how this plays out.",0

"Hello guys, I would like to establish the Kingdom of Sarnor on the rp at some point (whenever I get a free character slot), but it was recently on my mind and I thought it might be good to iron out some details before that happens. So, time for the history mumbo jumbo.

We assume that the Doom of Valyria occurred around 105 BC and directly after that commenced the Century of Blood that swept through Essos. During this time, the Kingdom of Sarnor was decimated by the Dothraki, almost completely slaughtered after the Field of Crows. The Tall Men were driven back to Saath and numbered only about 20,000 after all was said and done and the Century of Blood was over. We'll say it's been about 500 or so years since this point to where the rp is now. My point is to figure out a rough estimate of the current population of Sarnor (other Dothraki raids notwithstanding and can be calculated into the total when all is sorted). 

I've done three calculation for you mods to decide between.

* 5% Birth rate (A generous number and the least likely of the three, but I figured I'd throw it in) would leave the current population at 500,000 in the year 505AC
* 3% Birth rate (Average, more akin to the birthrate seen in the world today) would leave the current population at 300,000 in the year 505AC
* 1% Birth rate (A somewhat low number, but could be completely understandable if factoring other wars and raids into the figure) would leave the current population at 100,000 in the year 505AC

Thank you for reading this little bit! As I said before, these populations do not take into account various other raids or catastrophes that might have happened. Also, I understand this sub is about storytelling and not about hard numbers and the like, but I feel having a mod approved rough estimate of the population would only be a good thing for world building in a civilization that was once destroyed.

I like it when he's laid down and I'm squatted onto him, facing his body because then I can usually attend to him with my mouth and hands whilst he does that, haha.

&gt;Amy is a klutzy girly-girl who likes to party a lot and is flexible in being wooed by men. She is kind of spoiled due to her parents being rich and she once used to look down on the poor. She has a sense of justice and patriotism but gets frustrated a lot when she is in desperate and hard situations. She constantly gets guilt ridden when she does something wrong. She is also naive and falls for many things. Amy might also be bad at placing and losing things such as failing to hide her wallet in her pocket fully only to get it stolen by people like Bender. She is also rebellious against her parents in their many schemes such as their plot to destroy twelve percent of the Milky way to build a giant mini golf course.

"On a good day? Every few hours. On a bad day, pretty much non-stop to varying degrees.

It's a complex beast. There's a combination of ingrained responses and values that I'm actively working to overwrite, past hurts that don't really get erased by logical counterarguments, the standard battery of subclinical brainmess (self-esteem, anxiety, codependent tendencies etc.), trust issues, communication issues, jealousy, envy, fear, and a sea of unknowns and uncertainties about the future, my relationships and my own feelings, desires and hypothetical responses to new stuff I'll probably have to deal with sooner or later.

But at the end of the day, I chose this and I'm fucking going to make it work.

I've had to experiment with various responses and strategies. I tried to dial back my emotions and care level but it was erratic at best, and constantly fighting myself like that was exhausting.

I've tried opening up and being completely honest and communicative of my feelings and that was even worse, because there's way more stupid whiny petty hurtful shit in my head than anyone else should have to deal with, and I wound up regretting a lot of things I said and instantly wished I could take back. That's just not the version of me I want to present to my partner, or to the world in general.

At the moment I'm hovering around a slightly modified, hopefully more sustainable version of what you've described. I don't *deny* my emotional responses, but I do try to filter them, and force myself to take time to think my way through stuff before I say or do something I regret. Sometimes that means delayed responses or removing myself from situations if I'm not sure how I feel about them, and I don't always get it right, but I think it's helping. I'm working to keep pushing my boundaries and comfort zone, albeit gently, and to stay as outgoingly positive as I can without being insincere. Basically aiming for honest words, pleasant demeanour and trying not to make my problems anyone else's unless I have to. It's still a bit hit-and-miss, but I think I can get it right, and I know it's worth trying.",0

"&gt; People ought to be able to bitch and moan as much as they want.

If this is a 'Freedom of Speech' principle, I'm going to throw out a simple point.

People ought to be *able* but they should not ought to be *inclined.* 

'Bitching and moaning'? I think we can both tell from your simple use of terminology that it's just negativity. If it was people throwing compliments in earnest, randomly, I would consider the matter differently. But I do not see much reason in 'bitching and moaning' without seeking a *real* solution.

Bearing in mind I had only read those words as I've typed this. I'm not assuming anything of you.

&gt; The ought to be able to do that without people jumping down their throats calling them 'self entitled assholes'.

I didn't call them assholes. I'm quite careful with things like that.

I'd argued that it's self-entitled and currently I stand by it. I have provided reasons as to why I find that as the case.

&gt; It looks free because you don't pay anything to play it. But if people don't buy skins, if people don't buy champs, if people don't buy stuff, then the game can't exist.

For the record, I've spent a decent sum of money on the game. That shouldn't be relevant, but in the case that you were using a logical fallacy (argumentum ad hominem - ""argument against the man"") I'd like to refute it. In the case that you're making the point that it is not free, then I'd like to specify that ""Free-to-play"" refers to those who choose to play it that way.

You are right in saying that without payments, the game could not exist. Could Riot Games even exist if that were the case? Maybe, I don't know. But it is free to many people, and any new player who chooses to play now also has the choice to pay; they are not mutually inclusive options.

Same for any one player who does it now. The only time this changes is if we consider all or most players making this decision.

&gt; As such, we're entitled to say what we like about what Riot adds to the game.

You purchased what you purchased; your skins, your champions, your Rune Pages.

You do not gain entitlement through spending money. You do not gain possession of the game through spending money. You do not gain a louder voice by spending money.

Why would you? It is very ignorant to assume that Riot's on *your* or any other individual's payroll. That's why voting with your wallet is sound reasoning. Does it always get heard, though?

Of course not, because there are -- particularly in League of Legends' case, *millions* of other players making the same considerations but making different choices to you.

If you stopped paying right now, maybe they'll notice a digit or two go down. Do you think that if we both stopped paying right now, it would change their minds at all?

If I had spent £0 on this game, I would consider myself as entitled to talk about the game as I am now. The principle is that it is people's *choice* as to what they do with their money, and if they do not choose to purchase skins/chromas/Riot Points, then that is perfectly acceptable.

So, my overall point is that you *are* entitled to say what you'd like. But not only is that *not* sufficient reason to say what you'd like, but it is *not* because you 'bought' that right.

&gt; It's not being an asshole to say your mind.

Never said it was.

&gt; It's not being a douchebag to complain.

It could just be ignorance, or stupidity, or a temper, or a bad day. Could be plenty of things.

But if you think about it logically and you have a moment of self-awareness, you're not going to 'bitch' unless you thought it would change something. People 'bitch' everyday. To people they know can't resolve the situation.

Going to Reddit? Sure, that could make an impact; people do take in views from here from time to time.

But if someone is going to identify an opposing view as ""ridiculous"", then I'm inclined to identify such perspective as ignorant, in this case.

&gt; It's our right as the people who make the game what it is.

You have way too much ""consumer empowerment"" going through you right now.

&gt; And if Riot comes out with a product that I think is fucking stupid and overpriced, I'm gonna say ""Riot, that shit is stupid and overpriced. Heroes of the Storm has it for free. Make it the way I want it."".

In other words, you're self-entitled.

Which is fine. But I'd rather go about it some way like this.

""Riot, X as a concept has a lot of potential to work, and I honestly think you can pull it off quite well. But I don't think that it's cost-efficient for many people who play League to actually buy this. 

It offers Y, Z, Alpha and Beta, which is great, but there's quite a lot of room for improvement in either cost or features and I think that without it, I'm not going to find it an appropriate expense and I think that that'll be the case for a lot of potential customers, too. I mean, look at your skins and chroma packs; they do pretty well at these prices. I don't know how much work it takes for you to make X and if it *needs* to be that high, but if it can drop down in price, it'd be a much more appealing offer.""

Also, you're talking about another game whose skins can cost £10.00 by themselves the *majority* of the time. Only Ultimate skins are like that in League. 

If you want to keep trying to quantify between Blizzard and Riot Games, then might I point out the Pay-to-Play *business model* that World of Warcraft has?

*And* it has micro transactions?

Blizzard / Riot Games are apples and oranges, just like MMORPGs and MOBAs or a MOBA and another MOBA. Don't try to draw comparisons, because it's not going to stand very well.",0

"&gt; The guy in the basement has no obligation to try and keep the game balanced, or stable, or in any way satisfactory for the millions of existing owners of the game.

and yet, people still want modding capabilities ingrained into the game. Since Mojang, the creator of a game that is owned by millions, said they were going to add modding ***half a decade ago***, but have yet to deliver, people looked to unofficial sources for their demands.

&gt; The guy in the basement is free to be selfish and greedy with machine resources to achieve their effects, and need not care if their mod breaks any other features of the game.

People are also free to not download crappy mods.

&gt; The guy in the basement is free to abandon his work at any time and not worry whether the game will survive into the future.

So is Mojang. They don't have to forever keep updating their game.

&gt; Mojang must take these things into account and it constrains what they can do and how they do it.

If Mojang were to add official support, and give a standard to which mods need to meet in order to effectively run in game, the modders would build their mods around that.

any good striker Bader cant consistently take down outclasses him on the feet, that would definitely be the case with Rumble, i dont know if you know this but Rumble has great Takedown defense; 85% and Davis couldnt do anything vs him, I doubt Cormier will be able to just lie on him, he might be able to take him down a couple times but its also going to be stand up fight and Cormier could actually win and would be a deserving champ unlike Bader imo

out of curiosity but how has Bader improved a lot? his striking is still not good and he relies way too much on his wrestling, his 2 big wins over OSP and Davis he didnt look all that good, he just outwrestled OSP which he cant do against the elite guys and vs Davis it was just bad stand up fight between 2 wrestlers which nobody won, the judges were just forced to pick a winner and 2 picked Bader",0

"If you're at the end of the game, you're most likely gonna need to do a another playthrough. Only a dozen or so of Rise's navigation lines are triggered during specific boss fights, and you're most likely leveled too high to pick up all navigation lines you missed. Here's some tips on how I got it:

* Play on Hard or higher difficulty. If you're over-leveled, you'll miss many of her lines.

* You will have to use all of the characters, there's no way around it. In your next playthrough, get to the top of each dungeon, exit, switch out all your characters, and start again from the bottom. Look for enemies that cause status ailments, and keep fighting them with every character until you've heard all the lines associated with that ailment.

* Don't guard or heal characters. Let them get knocked down and affected with status ailments. Each effect on each character has two or three lines associated with getting inflicted with each ailment.

* Don't level up your party's S. Links. Doing so will let characters help each other recover from effects. Rise has dozens of lines for characters recovering from ailments on their own.

* Do level up Rise's S. Link as fast as you can. The lines she says about enemies' weakness at the beginning of each battle count. She also has many lines for when she helps you in battle, including taking damage for you and recovering knocked out characters.

* You can try scanning every enemy you fight, but there's no clear consensus whether those lines count or not. I did it anyway.

I got the trophy in the Hollow Forest on my first playthrough, but I was actively trying to get it to pop. Some people get lucky and get it without trying, but I've heard of others doing three or more playthroughs and never getting it. Do everything you can to trigger lines, and you shouldn't have a problem.",0

"In 5th edition, your skills (perception, deception, investigation, etc) don't use a point system to increase. The bonuses to each skill is determined by two things: your ability score (strength, dexterity, intelligence, constitution, wisdom, charisma) and your proficiency bonus.

Your proficiency bonus scales up as you level, and what skills it's applied to depends on your class and I think your background.

Your ability scores are generated when you make your character, and can be done by what's called the point-buy system that is outlined in the player's handbook, but a quick google search should tell you how it works, as lots of systems, such as pathfinder, and even older versions of D&amp;D use it. Alternatively you can do it old school, and take 4 six sided die, roll them all, drop the lowest die, and add the rest together

The ""bonus"" from the ability is usually the only number you care about, not the actual score itself, and is determined by taking the score, dividing by two and subtracting 5. So a score of 12, is a bonus of +1, but a score of 8 is a bonus of -1 (note, always round down for this, so a score of 11 is a bonus of 0)

Now for each skill you take the appropriate ability score bonus associated with it (ex wisdom for perception) and the proficiency bonus if applicable and boom, you have your total skill bonus",0

Case in point - I hated math at a younger age, until I found a teacher that had a disposition that nothing you could say or do could make her mad. She LOVED algebra and she loved teaching. If I had had more teachers like her in my elementary math classes, I would probably have loved math previous to her.

"I just bottled my dry hopped saison yesterday! Granted, I've only tasted the hydro sample, but it tasted pretty bloody magnificent. Recipe:

    8.5# Belgian Pilsner
    3# Flaked Rye
    .5 oz Mosaic @ 30
    .5 oz Motueka @ 15
    1.5 oz Mosaic @ 30 min hop stand (started chiller 15 min into stand)
    1 oz Motueka @ 30 min hop stand
    1.5 oz Mosaic - Dry Hop 5 days
    1 oz Motueka - Dry Hop 5 days
    Wyeast 3711 (1L starter)     

ABV: 5.4% (OG = 1.048, FG = 1.007)

The sample was super tropical fruit - lots of pineapple and mango, with some earthiness and other exotic-tasting fruit that I can't place. I'm hoping that the yeast and rye spiciness will come through a bit more, but if not it will still be damn tasty.

It obviously depends on what you're going for, but unless you want a tropical fruit bomb, I'd use one of Citra, Galaxy, or Amarillo and pair it with hops that have complementary, but not necessarily similar flavor profiles (Nelson would be good). I actually used those three hops in an IPA, and it was just a muddled fruit punch flavor. My experience in using hops with similar flavor profiles is that you have to be damn good with your hop schedules to get them to play nice together instead of becoming muddled.

You can even take the time to earn some platinum to use to buy CREDD with and continue your subscription that way.

Here are some tips that are mainly for new players but should be helpful to returning players as well.

http://www.reddit.com/r/WildStar/comments/3485dw/general_advice_for_a_noob/cqs849b

&gt; its nice to see new nexians, so for you the same advice as al, cause these are kind of FAQ for new players:

&gt; 1 go to pve server entity on NA or jabbit on EU (the pvp servers lack population, you will find more fun with us on pve)

&gt; 2 activate hold to cast in your combat menu, press escape&gt;combat&gt;input options&gt; hold to cast

&gt; 3 join the global channels, if you are on entity :

&gt;    exile side: /chjoin lfg
&gt;    dom side: /chjoin entitylfm

&gt; to talk write /1, ask anything there the community is very welcoming

&gt; 4 people tend not to use the looking for group tool, they tend to do premades so you will get faster queues if you make a group the old way, spamming in zone chat and global channels

&gt; 5 when questing the xp given are tied to the class of the quest, there are 5 classes

&gt; world story: gives the most exp, a must do quest Regional story: gives less than world story, do this ones too Zone story: gives a good chunk of exp but less than regional

&gt; task: gives the minimal xp, dont overstay in a place doing them, just do the other 3 classes of quest and move to other hubs

&gt; path quest: these dont give exp to level but to increase your path, you can come do this ones when you are level capped or do it for the sweet perks of your path for leveling (btw if you are maxed in your path these kind of quest will give xp instead)

&gt; 6 Moments of opportunity are the best dps enhancer in the game, to make one interrupt a mob when he is casting something, his hp bar will turn purple abd you will do 150% of damage (for interrupt, stun him or use abilities that say ""remove x interrupt armor""

&gt; 7 there is a lot of exp enhancers to make leveling fast and smooth (but the adventure is in the journey not the destination so if you want to feel the world and not rush it just dont use them)

&gt;    8% xp buff from guild
    8% xp from flask (you can buy it with renown if your guild has unlocked this perk)
    2% from authenticator
    5-10% from house (at lvl 15 you will get your own house, visit it once a day to get a buff for leveling, it can be 5% or 10% depending on the day)
    when log off leave your char into your plot, it will get rested xp (you can get more rested xp if you decorate your plot or even leave it in a fried plot who has the max decor buff)

&gt; 8 dodge a lot

&gt; 9 almost all in the UI is customizable, so you can move it to where you feel more comfortable, some people use forge UI as an addon for this, but there are addons out there for specific clases, cause well your interface changes a little between classes)

&gt; 10 there are a tons of usefull addons, i just use strikehardmeter for dps, latency meter for get a visual of the ping and LFG Board for getting groups (like the premade group finder on wow).

&gt; 11 when creating a char you can skip the first 3 levels by marking skip arkship, but if you are new i recommend not to skip it cause it will teach you some usefull things

&gt; 12 join a guild, this game its better with friends to play it and guilds give good perks

&gt; i think that cover the basic, good luck on nexus


Edit: I think I should mention that drop 5 [(Invasion:Nexus)](http://www.wildstar-online.com/en/news/2015-03-12-wildstars-next-big-update-invasion-nexus/) is coming within the next two months.  You may want to wait until then to use your 10 day trial if you are unsure you are ready to get back in.

"Seconded on the natural food sources.  I've had good luck with apple trees (craft an apple) combined with fern seeds from the fossils mod (they only grow under trees, but grow fast).  I did also make the trees artificially taller by planting them a few blocks up, and then filling in underneath with logs (I thinks it's prettier).

For my carnivores, I have pigs in with them.  Duncan could set up a little pig farm next to each pen with a chronotyper embedded in the wall to sort pigs into the enclosure.  Or just move some in with a lasso.

And of course, all of this would have been a lot easier if Duncan actually knew how to hand feed them!  Right click with an appropriate food, and it feeds and heals them (no need for potions).  He can use the Dinopedia to check what they eat.  Admittedly, I've had trouble doing this with full grown T-rexes, maybe because of their size.  But I've had no luck with feeders or tossing food on the ground.

Because the game doesn't check if the ruler should be alive, it is impossible for him to die until that date. Also, it doesn't check for regency except upon succession, so when the date your ruler is born on occurs you won't get a regency.

However, I have no idea how to actually modify a save file.",0

"In my foray into the professional world, I've come to realize that no one really knows wtf is going on at any given time. 

It's just my experience, but after watching companies run from the inside, I can say I wouldn't be shocked *in the slightest* that Marvel and Disney and DC and WB have no relevant research in this area. Quite a lot of the time, the decision makers go with ""common knowledge"" and ""their gut"" and don't even think of it in that manner. Hell, even if they did look for that kind of research, it's very likely they don't have it just based on the fact that they have always paid so much attention to marketing this stuff to boys. 

(For example, the medical field, and thus for things like dosage instructions on the back of medicine, for pretty much its entire existence ran on studies that were primarily made up of white men. It was only fairly recently that doctors - at least in the US - looked at things like diet recommendations and dosages and said ""hold up, why are we giving everyone the same instructions when there are very real differences to take into account here?"" That sort of thing happening in marketing as well isn't exactly farfetched.)

So, yes, ymmv, but as much as we'd all love these things to be logical - especially concerning business decisions, it's been my experience that it hardly ever is. ",0

When I was 16, I was about the same as you, I had a small chest even though I was 5'4"" and 155. I hated my body a lot. And it was not a fun time. Do your best to eat healthy, worry less about counting calories since 16 is a tricky age for controlling that. I'm not sure what you eat, but I know I had to watch my sugar and salt intake personally. Try getting involved in some sports or something active. And ironically, try not to worry about your body doing this. Try focussing on having fun if you're playing a sport and being healthy. Look at losing weight as a bonus. Taking care of yourself will make you feel 500% better, even if you don't see results. Don't worry about your body&lt;3

Come to terms with the fact that you may never develop certain parts. People's bodies vary a LOT, and some women simply don't have hips. And that's perfectly fine. I STILL don't have the bomb ass chest I dreamed of as a girl, but I play up the parts I do love. And even if you DO get those hips, if you're used to self-loathing, you'll just find something else you hate about your body. You gotta learn to love what you got and be grateful it's not as bad as it could be.

I know high school is a shitty time when you're surrounded by a lot of super skinny ladies, some of which have everything physically that you don't.

You've gotta learn to love who you are, because you're stuck with it. Be the best version of you that you can be.

First, Stokes theorem is used to get an integral over the boundary of the spheresection, which is precisely the circle at z=1. Clearly, this is also the boundary of the disk at z=1, so we can use Stokes theorem again to get the integral over this disk, which is much easier to calculate.

First of all, the n in this case is (0,0,1), so we're left with just the z-part of the vector. Second, the area of a disk is easy to calculate, so the final calculation is made a lot easier as well.

To give some physical explanation for why this is allowed. We're calculating the flux through this surface. Look at the object created by also adding the disk. Every fieldline that goes into the object, also has to come out, and since the field is pointed upwards, every line that exits through the spheresection has to enter through the disk, so the flux through the disk and the flux through the spheresection are the same.",0

"No. It's not so much an active dislike so much as disinterest. The texture doesn't bother me, I just find the flavourlessness undesirable.  Mild cheddar to me is like eating chocolate cake with the flavour magically removed. Why bother?  I found the paneer similarly bland. It was perfectly edible, but didn't make me desire to eat it. The seasonings applied were tasty, but could have been better applied to chicken, where they blended and complemented the flavour.  
I guess it was somewhat like eating cardboard tikka. good seasoning, but the heart of it wasn't something I desire to eat.  

I don't eat tofu for a couple reasons, but since it's a similar soft, mostly-flavourless blob that you just apply flavouring to, I imagine I would find it similarly undesirable.  (I eat meat, so I have no reason to turn to tofu, and I figure there are enough soy byproducts in so many other things these days that I'd just as well stay away from eating big chunks of soy. the only tofu I eat is in shelf-stable TVP ground form when backpacking, where it offers significant advantages over meat.)

&gt;__Indra's net__ (also called __Indra's jewels__ or __Indra's pearls__, from इंद्रजाल in [Sanskrit](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sanskrit)) is a [metaphor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metaphor) used to illustrate the concepts of [emptiness](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shunyata),  [dependent origination](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pratitya-samutpada),  and [interpenetration](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Buddhist_philosophy#Huayan_and_Avatamsaka-sutra)  in [Buddhist philosophy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Buddhist_philosophy).

&gt;The *metaphor* of Indra's net was developed by the [Mahayana school](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mahayana) in the 3rd century scriptures of the [Avatamsaka Sutra](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Avatamsaka_Sutra) and later by the [Huayan school](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Huayan_school) between the 6th and 8th centuries.

That is the Buddhist conception of the universe in an image."" –Alan Watts [1]*

"Well. I was kinda tripping out when I wrote that, but luckily I can translate a good majority of BO me's philosophies. 

The eyes are the windows to the soul. The eyebrows are the drapes. Your eyes show what you're feeling on the inside, your eyebrows show your reaction to those feelings/ what you're feeling on the outside. So if you're in a situation you're being judged, just keep them flat and don't twitch or knit your eyebrows. They move a little closer together and ""knit"" when you are feeling anxious or judged, but if you keep them flat or slightly arched, you appear to NOT GIVE A FUCK GANGSTER AS FUCK LIKE OCEANS. 

BO me was actually talking about shaving them off. This would equate to *no emotions* being reflected off. So 0% judgement.

Just in case I'll explain though.

&gt; Once they had been six, five whimpering blind in the snow beside their dead mother, sucking cool milk from her hard dead nipples whilst he crawled off alone. Four remained ... and one the white wolf could no longer sense.

The quote is doubly ambiguous. Specifically this part

&gt; Four remained ... and one the white wolf could no longer sense.

The ""four"" can refer back to either the ""six"" or the ""five"" from the previous sentence. Already this opens the door for GW being alive. If Ghost is saying that 4 of 5 remain... then Lady is still the only dead one.

The ""one"" is also ambiguous - it may refer back to the ""four"", meaning that Ghost can't sense one of the four as you're assuming. It may also be an independent clause, meaning there is an additional one besides the four.

---

Your reasoning that Summer can't be sensed because 

&gt; powerful magic swirling about

is pretty lame. Not sure how that's supposed to convince me when the text clearly states that Ghost can sense Summer

&gt; On the other side the wind was colder still, **the wolf sensed.** That was where his brother was, **the grey brother who smelled of summer.**",0

"There was definitely a plan in place imo. Adnan and Jay spoke briefly on the phone the night before. They spent the morning of the 13th together doing (?) I have come across theories that they could have been looking for a gun for Adnan to use in the murder. The Nisha call (Adnan made sure to put Jay on the phone even though he didn't know Nisha) and short visit to Cathy's house seem like an attempt at an alibi. Adnan was back at school in time for track. Imo it all went too smoothly for it to have been unplanned. 

On how close they were-I'd say they were probably just getting to know each other. Jay was older and more streetwise than Adnan, Adnan was a wannabe thug trying to impress him. Adnan flattered Jay's gangster image by asking him to help him, but I doubt Jay actually thought he'd go through with it. ",0

"Lol.  That's my comment you're talking about.  I'm a public defender.  Exposing lying cops is one of the favorite parts of my job.

Telling people they're probably shit out of luck is a pretty common response in the sub, but that's largely because there are a lot of posts that warrant that response.  I employ a similar approach with my clients:  I don't sugarcoat anything, and I focus on what we *can* do.  Sometimes this is quite a bit, other times it's not much.  

I do agree with you though that snark, derision, and telling people they're wrong, happen more than necessary. Lurkers seem to upvote based on entertainment value, so judgmental replies can sometimes rise to the top.  I can definitely be guilty of some snark, but I always attempt to include helpful questions or comments alongside.  And sometimes you have to dig a bit deeper or wait around for something genuinely helpful.

[Here's a good recent example](http://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/33oc2p/trespassing_charges_from_an_officer_for_crossing) where the top-rated comment tells the guy he's guilty, and then the guy comes along later on to say that he successfully fought the ticket.

We'd like you to get to know the place better before contributing, so for now, just sit back and enjoy the content posted here. Please read this entire reply as we're trying to help you become successful on reddit.

**First time redditors** should be aware of [reddit's site-wide guidelines](http://www.reddit.com/wiki/introduction). If you are planning to submit your own music, site, or channel in /r/music, you must read the guidelines for [self-promotion on reddit](http://reddit.com/wiki/selfpromotion). Violating these rules will result in a site-wide shadowban - that's just the way reddit operates, there's nothing we can do about it.

**New users** should take the time to read the [subreddit introduction](/r/music/wiki/introduction) to learn what this place is all about and how we operate. Tomorrow, you will be able to comment on threads but not submit posts to /r/music. Keep in mind that if you don't have anything positive or constructive to say in your comment, it's best to refrain from saying anything. 

New users must maintain a minimum positive karma score to submit posts in /r/music. Again, this is nothing personal, it's something we *have to do* to avoid spammers clogging up our feed to the tune of hundreds of submissions each day. We can't reveal what this score is, but we can tell you that anyone who actively uses reddit and is a *positive* part of the community will have no problem earning their way past this limit quickly.

**If you wish to promote in /r/music without participating in the community,** you can buy cheap ($5-$30) [sponsored links](http://www.reddit.com/advertising).

If you have any questions about reddit, please [read the reddit FAQ](http://www.reddit.com/wiki/faq).

**If you are just starting out on your career as a musician,** /r/music is not the place where you want to submit your works-in-progress or first musical creations.

"As ""meat projectors,"" once our chemical processes shut down then we will simply be nonfunctioning matter, like a broken CD. The data might still be there but it is unretrievable and has no purpose. In such a world there is no true love or kindness, evil or hate, there are just chemicals and hormones incentivizing and compelling us to act in certain ways. Some people believe this is the truth because they think science is rational, and there is no objective proof that there is something else.

My personal opinion is the double-slit experiment proves that science as understood by humans is still mysterious, subjective, and incomplete. The study of art and humanities (and psychedelics) have probed human experience and come up with explanations far more beautiful and terrible than what science alone can offer. What's the harm in believing in that we could be experiencing something much more magical than we know?

As a species, we should encourage the marriage of science and art instead of creating a false division between the two. We must explore our spiritual capacities, in addition to the scientific laws that bind our universe. Both can be true simultaneously.

"I was a melee player since release of melee. Yes I'm an old man. One thing I highly suggest is randoming! Random a lot! You can always focus on someone later. 

The characters are not the same and first attempts to play them as so can be frustrating. Randoming really allows you to explore the physics and tactics of a totally different game.  I feel as though it helped me find characters I liked much faster including ones I never thought I'd like. Being forced to try everyone really opens your eyes to the fact that a crazy amount of characters are viable in this game and a fresh meta. 

Honestly many of the fundamentals translate. Bairs are strong on almost everyone and pivoting into them really increases success. Paper scissors rock is definitely a major aspect. Forcing people into pressures decisions is where the greatest players shine. Mixing up approaches is crucial. Predictability is death no matter how fast you are. Empty hops and jabs are your friends.

"Pretty much what /u/Lluxx said. It doesn't help that the radical left has been getting progressively more and more radical as of late thanks to things like Tumblr and whatnot. In real life, amongst my friends and acquaintances, I would be considered pretty radical on a lot of issues, but in certain spaces here on reddit and other websites, I would very much be considered a moderate due to how far the left has moved.

Also, there's a small, but very vocal minority of people who identify as feminists or who are interested in social justice that use it as a way to bolster their own self-esteem by putting down anyone who isn't as radical as they are. A very holier-than-thou call-out culture, basically. When that's your first and main experience with feminism, it's not hard to imagine why someone would flinch at the thought of being lumped in with them and choose to identify with something else instead. I don't agree with it personally, since there's a lot more to feminism than the people bitching about nonsense on Tumblr, but I'm not surprised when people are turned off.

"It doesn't say it, but it can be inferred from the numbers easily. It said that 52.4% of hate crimes were committed by whites, and 24.3% were black. Whites are 77% of the American population, blacks are 13.2%. Whites are underrepresented and blacks are overrepresented in the hate crime stats. This is pretty simple math.


There are 5814 offenders

52.4% is 3047 offenders rounding up to the next whole number

24.3% is 1412 offenders rounding up to the next whole number


There are 245,532,000 whites in America

There are 41,600,000 blacks in America


We can divide the total number of offenders by race into their respective population totals and get:

1 in every 80581 whites was charged with a hate crime in 2013

1 in every 29461 blacks was charged with a hate crime in 2013


This makes blacks 2.73 times more likely on a national level to be convicted of a hate crime than whites, per capita.

"Necromancy is one of those things that's been codified as 'evil' because that's just the typical fantasy archetype for it, but not without good reason. As the classic alignments go, 'Evil' is considered selfish, disrespectful, and dishonorable, and necromantic magic falls into a lot of those categories. Some of the chief reasons include the following:

* General respect for the bodies of the dead. Most societies value the symbolic gesture of putting their dead to rest (which is why a lot of the time when a person dies in war or execution in other countries, they go to great lengths to get the bodies sent back home), so even if the corpse is mindless, their relatives and friends wouldn't take kindly to it.
* It's considered a cheap and horrible form of psychological warfare. Imagine you're fighting a war, one of your close comrades-in-arms dies, and next thing you know they're raised as a shambling corpse trying to kill you. It might be effective but generally it'd be considered a pretty abhorrent thing to do to someone, both the person who died and their loved ones.
* Depending on the game and the setting, necromantic magic (and other similar kinds of dark magics) are innately corrupting, degrading either the caster's soul or body.
* On that note (and I think this is the big one), I believe under the standard PF setting, raising a corpse with necromancy anchors the soul to that body, trapping them in their shambling corpse until the undead body is slain (that's why in the Golarian setting, Pharasma, the goddess of death, abhors necromancy; because it's a perversion of the cycle and keeps souls from her realm). So the whole 'putting their soul to rest' shtick is quite literally freeing their soul from their body so they can peacefully go to the afterlife.

Obviously all this depends on the setting. It's generally codified that necromancy follows a lot of these conventions, but depending on the setting it may be considered socially acceptable, and the rules about corruption and soul-anchoring may not exist, so it's less abhorrent for the person who's body it was.

If the setting your playing in has all those conventions, however, there's not much you'll be able to do to convince other people what your doing isn't somewhat abhorrent. The act of raising dead bodies isn't going to be something you can really make anyone feel comfortable about, and all other kinds of necromantic magic is inherently about torture and suffering, so again that's not going to win you any friends.

From a player perspective, what you want to do is accept that's the case and run with it. Maybe your character is trying to prove a point that not all necromancers are evil while being ignorant to the social and technical pitfalls with it? Maybe he's just genuinely ignorant and doesn't understand why everyone looks down on him for it? Think about those things with the above info in mind.",0

"Where are you hearing this? I recall the news that it ""wasn't quantum"" years ago, but everything I read about simply stated that it wasn't a full quantum computer; it most certainly houses qubits, and the methodology behind it is adiabatic wavefunction collapse. I don't completely understand how that can be used for computation, but I know Google is already using it to improve their search algorithms...using methods previously developed in adiabatic quantum computing theory. So it may not be a full ""quantum computer"" by some peoples' definitions, but they do advertise that these 512 qubits *are* addressable, they do charge *ten million dollars* for the thing, and it does perform algorithms based in quantum information theory. IMHO, that makes it pretty quantum, no? (Plus read the documentation on how the thing works; Josephson Junction coupling is still very much a quantum mechanical operation...)",0

&gt;And when the media, politician, or celebrity spread ideas that are incorrect we should censor them too?

Um, yes? Obviously? I work in the media, and our producers are constantly fact-checking and ""censoring"" their content to be sure that it's factually correct before they air it. Are you fucking kidding me?

So long as we can agree that the Bechdel test isn't a test which demonstrates whether a movie should or should not be made, but which can be used to examine movies made in a year in aggregate- it seems like a useful tool to me.

Back when we were doing the advocacy exchange project, we had a subject on the portrayal of women in popular media, and the bechdel test [featured heavily in what I wrote](http://www.reddit.com/r/FeMRADebates/comments/1y3pvf/taep_mra_discussion_portrayal_of_women_in_popular/cfh4984).

I guess the TLDR is: my only criticisms of the bechdel test would be if it is proposed as an absolute metric for the worth of a movie, or presented as an infallible way to identify whether a movie depicted strong women, or if it was presented as the only way to determine if a movie treated gender fairly.

"Its simply a test range nowhere in the film does it say that its some kind of gamma bomb test range. It could be radiation. The CLOUD DID NOTHING TO BRUCE PHYSICALLY it is a mental imprint of a horrible incident on him. The only exposure he had when he was a kid was the one he was born with. The mushroom cloud is simply an incident wherein everyone was evacuated and only the base was destroyed. The reason Bruce was able to withstand the Gamma Ray burst which would have killed anyone else was because of the regenerative trait he was born with that was passed on by his father. 

I think you have real issues understanding non-standard narrative devices. No one was exposed to anything in that blast other than possible radioactive drift, unless they made it out of the exclusion zone. Or it wasn't even radioactive. Mushroom clouds can be caused by all kinds of explosions. 

He needed to cure his son because he never intended for his son to be a part of the experiment and he had no idea what it would do to Bruce. In the end the passed down trait saved Bruce from a Gamma Ray burst that would have surely killed him. I have no problem with them figuring out a way to make it marginally more believable why Bruce would survive that Gamma Ray burst as it would melt any person exposed to it. In fact even his friend shouldn't have survived.

"I have very vivid dreams every night, here are the two most common.

- I walk down the stairs into a dark basement. There is always a door at the bottom. It slowly creeks open and a giant hissing crocodile emerges. I try to scramble up the stairs and keep tripping and falling the whole way up. I finally get to the top and collapse and my legs wont work. I try to scream for help but nothing comes out, all while this croc slowly gets closer and closer. Eventually it gets to me and eats me.

- This one the context of the dream is always different except for 1 detail it always takes place in the mountains. I could be riding a bike, in the city in the middle of a car chase, or in a park with some girl I wanna bang. Then out of nowhere a giant meteorite impacts the side of a mountain nearby and huge chunk of the mountain gets blown off and flies towards me. It is always so vivid and real. So this chunk is massive and I know there is nothing I can do but just watch it fly towards me. Right before it impacts I wake up.

I forgot about a sleep paralysis dream I get. Not as common as the other 2, I get it maybe 3 times a year. I will be lying in bed and then I wake up (at least I think I do) but I cant move a single muscle. The only thing that functions is my eyes. Then a black cat with glowing eyes will jump up onto the foot of the bed start hissing at and screeching at me while it slowly crawls up my body towards my face. I will try and kick and scream but nothing works. Its much like the Crocodile dream except I can see and sense everything going on around me. my girlfriend has even been watching TV beside me while it happens and looked at me and asked ""whats wrong with me?"" while I stare into space not blinking or moving. And I can see her and hear her but cant respond. eventually the cat gets to my stomach, crouches low lets out a hiss and pounces at my throat. As its mid leap it just turns to smoke and disappears. The second it disappears I can move and scream, and I do every time.... The weird part is everything stays the same its like the only thing that was dream was the cat that was put into the real world that I see in front of me. ",0

The stab has a fairly longish cooldown, and a long range. Usually it is not the distance that is the problem, but the angle, and when it is the distance it is usually by only a step or two.

Spike has a shorter range than stab and a longer cool down (8 ish seconds).

"My only UFO experience was while standing over a hill overlooking my hometown with a few of my closest friends from high school; we were all just standing there, facing the mountain and talking.

Suddenly, a HUGE ball of light with a white hot center and green rim shot across the sky, starting from the top-right corner of our vision and passed over the mountain in front of us within a second, *maybe* a second and a half. The weird thing was that it lit up the top part of the mountain it was passing over... like, a lot of it. It was real bright.

We all just sorta sat there for a second until someone piped up... uh, did anyone else see that? Agreed on color, shape, momentum. Our skeptic said it had to be a missile test from the nearby military spot but that thing was flying relatively low to the ground which is super dangerous, the base is 30 miles away, and that thing was moving CRAZY QUICK. Like, at least 5x the speed of an airplane at the same relative distance.

I also had an ex -- born, raised and practicing Catholic, never really ventured into any philosophy or other religions -- who would fall into trance and speak in really esoteric terminology.

For some context, the video was about Verdun, a PC exclusive WW1 shooter.  It's especially crucial in times like these when a console gamer admits a PC would be good to have, to be nice and helpful to them, providing cost effective builds, and overall giving a good impression, instead he got the same old troll comment putting him down for owning a different system, even calling him a peasant even though, as far as I can tell, he's no where near that.  Imagine how quickly we could have had him take an interest in PC gaming!

It's not ""I thought Shirin's edit"".

There was plenty of film that could have made the core 6 likable or human, but they chose very actively to make them awful so that when Mike wins it will be more triumphant. The issue with that is that all of the episodes leading up to Mike's victory suck, because of the false hope manufactured by the storytelling. Compare to an actual good season like PI, where the Rupert boot wasn't handled as ""Don't worry, Rupert will pull through"", but as this incredible tragic fall of a hero.

I think they are a cool idea, but Id prefer they be sold separately rather than together. Even if all 3 would cost more than the current 590 or what ever it is, Id still prefer them being liek 300 each.

Its like people on video game auctions. You have a stack of 50(say 2 gold each for a total of 100g) of an item, versus a stack of 200(1g each for a total of 200g) of an item. The latter is cheaper per unit, but you only need 50...So while I am paying a little more for less, I am overall paying less gold for what I need.

Same applies here. Hell, release them separately for 300 each, and release them also as a bundle where its buy 2 get 1 free kind thing. This makes the pack price 600, while individually costing 900 total.",0

"Good analysis.  I do not think nefarian will see competitive play though, the variance is too great.  It isn't like shredder where you have a general sense you will get a ~2/2.  You get awful, good in 1 circumstance, in another situation this would be good, meh, and Holy cow this wins me the game.  You do not get the filter like thoughtsteal, and more than likely, the spell itself will not win you the game.  

Now Ysera's card is always good (not always the best), but always good.  If you are comparing the two,   80% of the time I prefer ysera.  Chrommagus is tricky.  I think certain decks will want to play Chrommagus, but in general, the other two are better, because you get immediate effect.  ",0

"Because much of the Torah needs explanation. It's like trying to build a car without the instructions. Sure, you can put pieces of it together on your own, but eventually, you'll need explanations. 

This is what Aish.com has to say on the matter:

&gt;The story is told about a fellow who applies for a job at a prestigious investment banking firm. The interviewer looks at his resume and says, ""I see you went to Harvard Business School. Very nice. Tell me, what year did you graduate?""
The fellow says, ""1990.""
""1990. Did you ever take any courses with Professor Stevens?""
""Stevens? No.""
""Okay, how about Professor Phillips? He's one of the most popular professors at Harvard. Older fellow, grey hair. Did you meet him?""
""Nope, never heard of Phillips.""
""You went to the Harvard Business School and you don't know two of the most popular professors?! I don't get it. Did you attend Harvard or not?""
""Well, I guess I should be honest with you. I didn't actually go to Harvard. My roommate attended the Harvard Business School. He used to bring home all his notes and textbooks, and I read everything he brought home. So when he graduated, I figured I graduated, too.""
The interviewer was not impressed. And our ""graduate"" didn't get the job. (Or if he did, it's one of those firms that's out of business now...)
Why isn't it enough just to read the notes to be considered a Harvard graduate?
Because you need to hear the lectures. The professors add so much information that the notes simply don't present a full view of the subject. If you want to get a full understanding of a text, what's the best way to find out? Ask the experts: ""What's behind this? Please explain it.""
Information in the written form is, by definition, secondary and limited in scope. That's why the Oral Torah is 50 times the size of the Written Torah! (In actuality, the Oral Torah is infinite. It contains the totality of Torah, which – as the word of the infinite G-d – is by its very definition infinite.)",0

"Afraid the other answer is not correct. Insurance in almost all US states follows your vehicle. Once you allow someone to drive your vehicle, you are assuming liability if they are in an accident. (Which is why, for example, insurance companies can deny damages caused when a car is stolen.) 

If your vehicle was in an accident and your insurance company had to pay out either to you or the other vehicle/property that was damaged - regardless of who was driving - that is a claim on your policy. If the driver of your car wasn't at fault, hopefully there will be no surcharge. If he/she was at fault, you will lose any ""No Claim"" discounts you have and may also see a surcharge if the claim exceeds whatever threshold your company has set. ",0

"Your observations are correct.  I do look for those subtle reinforcements because I don't want to see them.  I want to eliminate them off my list of things which are or are not possible.

I started having a thought about a year ago.   I came to the stunning realization that I'm the only thing in existence that can feel any way about me.   That didn't change that fact that outside influences had an effect on my feelings, but to really realize that was pretty important I think.  Even when others judge you, it's your feelings that make you feel what you feel. 

Also, that feeling you described about feeling ""bad"", and ""Not worthy"", those are bang on.   Because I've realized that I feel very uncomfortable around innocence.   Around babies/children, dogs, really kind people, family....etc.  I am naturally attracted to dark things, those things interest me more than positive light things, and that's supposed to be bad and negative.    My idea of heaven is not white and bright things and perfectly clean clothing, it's carnivals and fun houses, and fast cars and tunnels that lead to alternate dimensions and entertainment (basically Earth minus the shit I don't like)....etc.   I've always wondered if that is spiritual, or psychological, or if they are one and the same.  I've heard it's kind of common to be afraid of children, but I think it's weird.   I guess i'm into some stuff that most would consider kind of shameful, and I know that if they knew they'd feel differently about me.  Only my closest friend knows about one of them, and I am very fortunate that he is alright knowing it.  The way I feel, is beyond my control though...But one can feel like a dud, when comparing themselves to the status quo or general ideas about what constitutes a good soul, or a corrupt damaged one.  it's natural I guess.

As a future teacher (1 more year) I've heard that one of the best places to get discouraged form teaching is the teacher's lounge. Usually because teachers go there to get away from the kids and often times complain about them. Surrounding yourself with people who don't like kids will make you not like kids. So I think it's bad for a different reason in that these teachers will begin disliking teaching more and more and will hurt students views to learning before they quit. You have to love kids and teaching otherwise you're doing a disservice to the students.,0

"It's not too confusing if you are cynical enough to believe people will be duplicitous and manipulative if given the chance.

The writer ""Zak"" bugged Eron to do an interview for an extended period. Eron is smart but incredibly naive - I assume this Zak guy assured him he'd write a fair article. Instead, he likely intended to trash him all along, while assuring LW he'd make her look good.

It was interesting that the Zak guy seemed to create a new twitter account to ask Eron for the interview. I googled it the other day and it seemed there was only one tweet (this is a separate account from his real twitter account).

Another interesting point in Eron's tumblr response was that he logged into his Facebook account on Zak's laptop to show him the chat logs with LW. So there's no excuse for Zak having overlooked the abuse and deceit Eron was subjected to.

This all tells me Zak is an SJW, an activist writer who intended all along to smear Eron. It's beyond my comprehension why Eron would agree to an interview after the three or four hit pieces SJW journalists did on him last Fall.",0

"You don't trade out a trait line, you just don't specialise in it. If a ranger traits in Marksmanship, Skirmishing and Beast Mastery, they aren't trading out Nature Magic or Wilderness Survival, they are just not specialising in those traits.

The only thing which locked you into specific specilisations rather than choosing what you want was the reveal that you only choose three trait lines to specialise in. It ended up having nothing to do with elite specialisations.

Honestly, when you look at the proposed trait lines, they are seem similar to elite specialisations anyway - longbows will build Marksmanship, Traps and Shortbows will build Skirmishing, Spirits will take Nature Magic etc. Locking down the staff to the Druid trait line seems like less of a limitation when you consider than most players running an existing weapon are heavily encouraged to trait that weapon anyway.",0

"I came out to my parents when I was 20 and for the next 10 years or so, we had off and on contact. I didn't go searching for a parental figure, but looking back, I realize that I related to many of my managers as parental figures. [I'm an engineer working in product development organizations.] Frankly, many of those managers helped me grow up. Sometimes I was sort of ""adopted"" a bit by my partner's parents as well.

Now I am in my 50's and a manager. I wouldn't say I play a ""parental"" role in some people's lives, but I am on the mentor side more often than on the ""being mentored"" side.

One thing I have noticed throughout my career is that there are a lot of people, straight and gay, who seem to be seeking parental approval (as I did) in vain. Unfortunately, having a messed up relationship with your parents is not exclusive to being gay/lesbian, but it sure seems more common amongst us.",0

The thing is that Iran is merely a signatory, and the United States hasn't signed that UN Convention at all-- so both sides use their status to suggest they can act abnormally.  Iran claims they can dick around if they want, and the US has warned everyone that they *will* dick around if others do.",0

Hello! Your post has been automatically removed because I believe it is a tweak release post that uses a Cydia screenshot. If it isn't, please disregard the rest of this message and contact the moderators to get your post approved.

Cydia screenshots aren't very informative when it comes to release posts because it usually tells people nothing other than the name of the tweak and repo it is hosted on. It doesn't give us any screenshots, description about the tweak, or its price and thus doesn't help people decide if it is a tweak they would find useful. You're welcome to repost this, but please follow these two steps first:

1. Check to see if somebody else hasn't already posted it. If they have, then there's no need for you to post it.
2. Check out our [wiki page on making good posts](http://www.reddit.com/r/jailbreak/wiki/greatposts)
3. Post a link to the Cydia depiction, a [link to the package](http://redd.it/19ppxl), a tweet made by the developer, or an article or YouTube video about the tweak

Thanks for understanding!

Totally agreed with this one. I would love to see classic characters make a return, even if that means going back to the traditional martial arts roots, I would appreciate it.



&gt;Make Gohan a strong character

Everybody seems to be complaining about this recently. 
Thing is, just because a character can't bench press a planet, it doesn't mean that character isn't ""strong"".
 
I've also heard comments about Gohan being ""useless"", which isn't true.
Gohan can become a witty character that outsmarts the enemy instead of bare brawling them to death.

Then, I wake up and continue to feel awful and guilty about the dream and how convinced I was of what's happening.

I don't know why these happen. I never have cheated on anyone, and I don't plan to. I think it stems from a distrust of myself, distrust of self control, and fear of how I would react to myself if I were to cheat on someone.

I rarely dream, but when I do, it is incredibly convincing. Since I dream so little, this dream makes up a solid 5-10% of my dreams and I always wake up believing it happened, and not realizing it was a dream for a few minutes.",0

You're saying to setup the verizon as modem only, plug it into a 3 port business class router that supports vlan, use a port on that router to go out to the 16 port switch for the business wired network.

Then, inside the router, configure a vlan just for wireless. Just want to make sure I'm understanding correctly. Thanks!",0

"That's an interesting Theory. Since I'm an engineer and not a theoretical particle physicist, I enjoy working with tangible objects instead of weird little matter bugs. So that kind of theoretical drive is too beyond my understanding to offer a comment to the affirmative or negative. However, it sounds plausible. If a particle was spun (enough to provide a measurable, useful change in space-time) and shot by a compact particle accelerator (or it could drift into it, who am I to judge a lazy particle?) into an energy uptake system on the other side, I can see that working. This field change would need to be modulated to provide more efficient  ""forward"" travel through space-time. Modulated or given an ""anti-spin"" (as I see it it my head) to cause a (to me) a necessary opposite shift in space time at the other end. Where a higher point mass might cause a contraction of space time on one end, and a higher ""anti""mass would cause an expansion. My use of anti doesn't mean I'm necessarily suggesting spinning an anti particle, because I don't know much about antimatter and the like and their properties. I just mean ""do the opposite on the other end"".

It's might be possible that doing the same thing to something else might produce expansion. It's also possible that a different method is the only way of doing that and the uptake system could power that too. Who knows. 

But yeah I really like your input. I might contact you about your opinions while I do these articles. I'd also like to get drunk and have a conversation about this stuff with you. I believe that would be a good time. My brain hurts less when I think about things like this from a very specific view point for too long.

"I personally think that she is going to be just fine where she is right now.  At her age I was just fine, and I see her being treated well, so I'm pretty sure she's going to be just fine. Not to mention the few times my parents have been away she was immediately filled with separation anxiety, so it would be best if I could leave her where she is now.  Parents treat her fairly, they don't yell, they may be pretty strict at times but I don't think that necessitates removing her.

I understand what you are saying, and I thank you for your kind words and wise thoughts.  I think my little sister will be just fine if she stays with my parents. In time, she will start to clash with them in her teen years and I will be there for her.

What I need to focus on right now is me. Like it says in the OP, should I be trying to move out by the end of the school year or a month before?

First, the crops which get cut will be the least important ones.  Almonds are getting a lot of flak, but they're high price products and will continue being produced.  Rice and alfalfa (which can be grown in a ton of places, and are very water intensive) are the low hanging fruit for what farmers may stop producing.

Second, the commodity price of vegetables is a pretty small chunk of overall food costs.  Much more of the food budget of Americans goes into meat, packaging, transportation, and marketing than does commodity vegetables.

Third, there are substitution effects.  California produces a lot of vegetables, but lots of vegetables get grown in other places too.  For instance, green beans are primarily produced in slightly colder climates.  It's quite possible that people will eat fewer of the vegetables California specializes in, and more of some other vegetables, when the price changes.",0

&gt;Devices that combined telephony and [computing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computing) were first conceptualized by [Theodore Paraskevakos](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theodore_Paraskevakos) in 1971 and patented in 1974, and were offered for sale beginning in 1993. He was the first to introduce the concepts of intelligence, [data processing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_processing) and [visual display screens](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Visual_display_screen) into telephones which gave rise to the ""smartphone."" In 1971, Paraskevakos, working with [Boeing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boeing) in [Huntsville, Alabama](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Huntsville,_Alabama), demonstrated a [transmitter](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transmitter) and [receiver](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Receiver_(radio\)) that provided additional ways to communicate with remote equipment, however it did not yet have general purpose [PDA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PDA) applications in a wireless device typical of smartphones. They were installed at Peoples' Telephone Company in [Leesburg, Alabama](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leesburg,_Alabama) and were demonstrated to several telephone companies. The original and historic working models are still in the possession of Paraskevakos.

As to your last point I said *you* absolve people of their responsibility. If you enter into a 30 year contract without taking the time to understand the risks involved, or hire someone who can explain it to you, then you are taking on a level of risk you should be willing to accept. You're saying it's not these peoples fault.  Well who else is at fault for getting a mortgage they can't afford? Who else decided to buy a house with no money down on an ARM? When you buy a house you can't afford, just like anything else, you run the risk of losing your home. Period.

"Except that this assumes our goals are opposite and our voices equal.

The tension you describe requires us to be in constant balance of forces.  If one group or voice becomes the stronger, and using that strength reinforces itself, then it becomes impossible for the tension to be maintained.

That view has a certain appeal, the ideal of symmetry is elegant and if achieved, powerful.

But it is also fragile.

At present it is best to imagine that the rope in the middle, that which we pull back and forth in our tug of war, has begun to fray.

As that takes place we separate, and worse yet, we stagnate.

Should that rope that binds us together snap entirely, we end up at war within our own nation, the very end that democracy seeks to avoid.  Whether through violent civil revolt, or the militarization of domestic police forces, the peace we sought to maintain is broken.

That's why it's impossible to get anything done.  That centre place of compromise grows thin and weak, it won't support the kind of work that needs to be done.

It also makes us vulnerable to outside changes.

The tension between workers and employers for example is a careful balance.  Introducing the concept of climate change, and the necessity of action on that front adds another rope to the pull on neither of those sides.  Workers fear for their livelihoods, and employers fear for their profits, so both pull against the greater good, attempting to strain enough to move the mountain that is reality.

In essence, this only works for the most limited of scenarios.  Perhaps it might work to encourage the poorest to pull against the richest.  But there is no centre point or common ground where reality is concerned.  It is what it is, and no amount of politics or voting or compromise will change that.

So at times reality will loom on that fringe, and we must all decide to abandon our previous arguments and tensions and move to safe ground.  If not, the floods will raise the water over our heads, and our tug of war will see only floating corpses still clinging to a now slack rope.

We have to be willing and able to vote according to our good conscience, our true wisdom and our intellects, not only according to our momentary benefit. ",0

"It does not perform like a quad core. Hyperthreading greatly reduces time spent switching between threads. It basically eliminates any performance penalty from running 2 processing threads on 1 available core because of this, but those two threads still only get 1/2 of the CPU's attention each.

4 physical cores will double your performance (100% improvement) if all of them are busy. Hyperthreading increases performance from 0% to 30% depending on what you are doing.

That's not bad at all, and when you have only 2 cores you are quite likely to multitask and take advantage of Hyperthreading compared to the same tasks on a hyperthreaded 4 core CPU.

So this is one of the many factors that improve this CPU's performance compared to an older processor (or an AMD processor) but it unfortunately is not the same as having 4 cores-- ever ",0

"DPS means nothing in Planetside 2 unless you could guarantee that every single shot hits the target. Thus, we use TTK, and that doesn't factor in 99% of the time when flying either.

The reason Tomcats are hated is the fact that 'they take no skill to use', which, while being rather generic, is also correct. Keeping a lock while under fire causes you to die quicker, as you just have to keep it in the general area, rather than matching the manoeuvres performed by the enemy, which has the side effect of dodging enemy fire.

If you want to use a secondary other than afterburner tanks, go with the Coyotes. While they do little damage, they damage the enemy while your primary is reloading, enabling you to keep up the damage as much as possible. People will respect you far more, and will be willing to teach you and fly with you if you use Coyotes rather than Tomcats.

As for dying a lot, I really hate saying this, but get used to it. It's only been recently I've been able to begin taking on enemy aircraft in a 1v1 and win, but against any pilot who has been flying longer than me, they will easily kill me (hence why I run stealth for ambushes and getaways). It's just the way it is. 'Softening' the blow of death through Tomcats really doesn't help much, because once you get good with the nosegun/Coyotes, it's scary what you can do. But with the Tomcats your flight style never changes, you never learn anything because you're always flying the exact same way: to keep the lock. 

If you want to become better whatsoever, ditch the Tomcats. It's nothing but a crutch.",0

"The other day I was talking to a younger black man and he claimed that it's impossible for black people to be racist. His reasoning was that racism means one race feeling superior to another race, and because black people have it so bad they can't possibly see themselves as superior to another race. They could be prejudiced, just not racist. A couple other black people agreed with him. ",0
"There is a huge difference between giving a shot to a person and to an animal.  First, humans have very small Subcutaneous space, as such the only injects that are given that way are generally insulin.  Give a person an injection between the skin and muscle with your average 25  or 22 gauge needle and you are asking to be punched in the face.  Human vaccines are given into a muscle as we tend to have large muscle bellies than a cat.

Prep for subcutaneous shots are also very different.  Try to tent my skin and I will punch you.  Don't tent a cats skin and you will either hit a muscle, a blood vessel or a nerve. Two of which can result in you getting bit if the person restraining isn't ready for it.  

So no, injections sound the same, but can be different depending on the species.  RN's are excellent at poking people, but without instructions shouldn't be poking any other species.

"Well; nice try assad's or iranian general or russian FSB. But i'd pick a variant of :

1°) consolidate heavily current positions. Train and integrate more the NDF before they end up as a free companies just looking for themselves. Oh and also let the tiger forces do their fuckin job alone if you want them to succeed.

2°) convince the russians or iranians to send an actual peace keeping mission. Large scale; with an actual trained modern army and lots of armor/air power. That can stand in the middle and defend themselves but disciplined enough. We're talking about tens of thousands of men. And/or an UN mission. They need trainers too to reform the SAA from scratch. There's a russian base in tartus. Perfect bridge head/staging point. That would even give an excuse to putin to train &amp; test &amp; show off his army against jihadis nobody cares much to leave in charge anywhere. Ru firepower would also probably convince the non-us-backed saudi to keep their no flight zone away from the actual russian military. Outright external intervention in his favor is probably his main chance at making it without killing half the country one by one.

3°) convince the western states (&gt;turkey) to keep standing aside (easy to negociate with stuff like ""end of the torture program for real with inspections"" ""the last remaining chemical weapons"" ""they will actually send in troops and not just missile everything to glass from the coast"" and ""i won't touch the kurds in the north"" and that could actually happen). Althought Sultan Erdogan 1st might be more a bit more hard to convince, he seems to have his own ideas on the question.

4°) reiterate the amnesty offer / ask anyone willing to have an actual future to negociate in a cease fire. That implies signing a real peace and probably some area partially autonomous :\ And not shabibas avenging themselves on the population now matter how tempting it is.

5°) push the crazy jihadis out with the ru military. ISIS is on their way out anyway, might as well carve their entire syrian territory with ru military.

6°) planify rebuilding the country. They could probably get international help to deal with the rebuilding, the destroyed/badly damaged infra and millions of refugees/displaced citizens. That's also a very easy way to endear themselves back a bit to the pro rebel syrians.",0

"I *love* Sapele, especially with a lot of ribboning in it. Outside of guitars, it's also become popular with kitchen cabinets and countertop manufacturers.

The problem with ""alternate"" woods like this, though, is that as companies jump on them as cheaper/more readily available, they're going to end up over-harvesting them just like they did with the ""old"" stuff. Luckily there are better environmental protections in place, but many countries where exotic woods grow also unfortunately suffer from lots of government corruption; it's *very* easy for unscrupulous wood vendors to grease the palms of the politicians and policy makers in a lot of those countries, which has historically been an issue with woods like ebony. Not only do *we* have to want sustainably harvested lumber, but we have to convince those other countries that it's in their best interest to responsibly harvest their own lumber. Because many of those countries have a high rate of poverty, they're more inclined to take bribes and look the other way, in many cases simply because they're just trying to survive.

It's a much more complicated issue than ""just don't cut too much down"". It makes navigating the waters of exotic lumber pretty tricky, especially if one wants to avoid questionably-harvested wood yet still use exotic timbers.",0

Not yet, apparently, if Florida's recovery is any indication.

But as has been pointed out, FEMA's new guidelines are BRUTAL in some areas, and can even restrict how much work is done on a property (50% of the appraised value) if the property is deemed in a flood zone. That aside, I read one news story of a commercial owner that saw a jump of insurance rates from $3500 a year to $50,000 (I think it was the Gulf coast).

"I was a generally sad child. But I don't feel like my problems stemmed from that. Years ago I decided that I wanted to join the army. It sounded like a good idea. Wrong. I'm not sure what it was that first triggered my major depression episodes, but it happened. I started falling apart. I had a rough experience. The army shuns the weak, both mental and physical. I'm strong but was still developing mentally at 18, still learning the world and who I was. Uncontrollable actions, such as fits of depression and anger made my life hell. The others picked up on it. I felt like they would rather leave me behind then help my up. I was right. I have one very vivid memory that I remember every day. I was laying in my bed (separated from the other beds in the middle of the room), with my two ""guards"" standing watch. Yeah, I had to have at least two people within arms reach of me at all times, even while sleeping. It got that bad. One of them decided he didn't have time for this. All I did was look at him and sigh. He took my pillow from under my head and tried to suffocate me. And I just laid there. Not moving. I didn't care. It didn't last long as the other people in the room (47 people) stepped in. After the event the drill sergeant walked in, unaware of the events that had transpired moments before. He walked up to me as I was laying in bed again. He bent over me and asked my how I was. I said that I was fine and he left. It has taken me a very long time to understand how I felt about this. Turns out I was angry at myself for failing something that I set out to do. I felt like garbage for so long. It took me 5 years to admit to myself that my self directed anger and loathing ment nothing. The past is the past. There is nothing that can be done about it. But my future, my happiness needs not be influenced by past failures. I was angry at myself, and I finally learned why. And I finally forgave myself.",0

"I'm not the previous commenter, but I'll give it a shot.  Presumably, these ancient Jewish judicial codes (if they had any validity) were ordered by God.  I would think any rule against gay sex then would be just as applicable now.  Honestly, for most thinking people, there needs to be an actual reason for a change in the laws (especially those mandated by God), but I can't see why any rule against gay sex then would be less applicable now.  Seriously, why would god say that homosexuals should be executed?  Why was that okay back then, but not now?

As for ""Hate the sin. Love the sinner"", it's like saying ""I still love you, but I hate a thing that you do that is (likely) closely tied with a major part of your identity.""  There's no denying that many people have used the Bible to justify hatred against gays.  And look at 1 Timothy 1:10.  It literally compares homosexuals to murderers and slavers.

"&gt;I suspect that the counter argument is that monogamous marriage limits that possibility since it lowers the number of people with the influence to force such a marriage.

 I was thinking specifically of arranged marriages, (although to be fair I didn't specify) so I'm not sure that holds up.  The coercion doesn't have to come from someone actually involved in the marriage

&gt;Another argument would be that polygamy is much harder to untangle if and when it does go bad.

I don't buy that either, but I can see why others might - you can say that it makes for somewhat more complicated divorce proceedings, but I think that the threat of complicated divorce proceedings aren't high on an abuser's list of potential threats.  Loss of economic support, loss of access to children, loss of social status - all of these are equally possible in monogamous and polygamous marriages.",0

"&gt;All that that shows is that saving humanity is preferable is preferable to not saving it. Assuming that that's not an option, prolonging the inevitable is seen as preferable to going quietly into the night.

But... then that's just straight up evil. It's the deliberate and premeditated murder of another human being(s) without even the dubious 'justification' of saving everyone else. Acknowledging that but excusing it through a utilitarian point of view opens up moral relativism, which is the ethics equivalent of saying 'well that's just *your* opinion.'

&gt;This is essential what OP wants to debate; not so much the morality of sacrificing a child from a utilitarian perspective (because any utilitarian worthy of the name is obviously going to argue that it's morally obligatory) but rather whether utilitarianism itself is moral.

And there's the rub. Utilitarianism is effectively the promotion of the necessary or lesser evil, which is *still evil.* It's a plainly amoral philosophy, and OP knows that or he wouldn't have said ""I know this is a utilitarian argument but..."" That  ""but"" let's you know he's about to dismiss the problems with utilitarianism. Which means he knows it's wrong but doesn't care because *results* and you can't really argue against that.",0

What would matter to Thoorin is if his short term power ranking boost continued into the next split, and helped his team improve their standings. Until then it's all about ""what if's"" or special matches that don't even account for at least 1/2 of that player's total game contribution. ",0

"Having spent another couple of days with OpenHAB I'm satisfied that it was the right way to go.

We want to have Android and iOS as the standard platforms for accessing and controlling house stuff. Kodi apps (Kore, Yatse, etc) for the media, OpenHAB for automation. Since every project (and its users) is different in significant ways, flexibility in the UI design turns out to be quite important.

With Domoticz and I was initially excited by the potential of the Lua scripting but OpenHAB has so many appealing bindings (plugins) available - bluetooth, networkhealth, TV interfaces, XBMC/Kodi...

Integrating with network monitoring apps like Cacti is important to me. OpenHAB will write its persistence data to RRDs if you want and I expect those will be pretty easy to make visible to Cacti. I have no idea how I'd get the graph data out of Domoticz short of scraping the database or manually exporting the graphs (in CSV?).

I'm still coming to terms with OpenHAB's use of Java and Xtend. The last time I did any serious work in Java was in 2002. It's matured quite a bit since (lambda syntax, whee!), so the learning curve for serious scripting is still steep.

There are a couple of tricks I've learned so far for OpenHAB UI configuration:

* Don't use Groups in the Sitemap (except as summary values). It's really tempting but just don't. Explicit is better.

* Don't bother with the Setpoint elements. They're currently very slow and user-unfriendly. Using a Selection with a mapping argument listing every possible value is actually so much more user-friendly.

"He hasn't had a solid year since the Vezina push in 12-13 where he had a. 924 Sv%. I'd imagine the Sharks will look to draft a goalie soon, probably higher up, considering they don't have any blue chip goalie prospects, and are pretty thin there. Maybe they go after Ilya Samsonov. There's no real chance Dubnyk leaves Minnesota for San Jose, so the only free agent they could go after that would make sense would be Niece himself, but I'd imagine there might be some difficulty since they don't seem confident enough in Nemo to give him a long term deal and a bridge deal may not be enough to keep him. Perhaps they sign and trade, or look for another option via trade. Bernier or Reimer could be available. There's a chance either Hammond or Anderson leave Ottawa, depending on how the situation develops with them and Lehner. Buffalo trades goalies all the time; maybe Lindback makes a comeback and they flip him for the rebuild. That's a bit of a long shot, but he showed promise at the end of the season with them. Maybe Vancouver moves Markstrom if he continues his rebound. Maybe with Gillies joining the Flames they look to move Ramo. There's even a chance they could go after prospects like Kristers Gudlevskis, Zachary Fucale or Malcolm Subban. I'm just saying they have options, but they will likely have to give up something to get a goalie here if theyre not drafting one. ",0

"&gt; My question here is what do I do?

Had a good chuckle with the responses here. They're absolutely right of course, but you have to wonder what the responses would have been had the genders been reversed - you being a girl with him going down on you constantly, but you refusing to give him a blowjob. I'd imagine folks left &amp; right would tell you that it's your body, your choice. That you don't have to do it if you're not comfortable with it. That if he can't accept that, he'd be a jerk for forcing it on you, and that he can just walk off a cliff, and stuff of that nature.

.

There was one similar post a few months back with just this scenario. Didn't end well, but the nature of the responses were more or less expected.

.

In your case, I'd start by apologizing for being selfish, and that you're absolutely willing to go for it. Tell her you're willing to do it, but slowly. Step by step. You want to give her the best possible experience possible, so you want to do it right the first time. Then follow up on it. You don't have to go full face in, start by going down while she's wearing thin pants. Then for the next session, let her wear yogapants and such. After you get used to it, change it to underwear. Ease off the pressure, take your time, and have fun. Tossing her salad is fun. Why do you think those girls in stock pics are always smiling eating their salads?

There are lots of exposed rocks and rapids here, but none more technical than class II+. Very low consequences. Once the Brushkana hits Monahan Creek the pace drops very quickly, although it picks up a bit once Monahan Creek joins the Nenana. 

Approximately 1.5 miles after joining the Nenana there is a 4-wheel trail on river left that leads back to the Denali Highway (1.75 miles). Or you can continue along the Nenana to where it rejoins the highway (~7-8 river miles).",0

"Yeah... unfortunately ST205s aren't available here yet. However, since the rule is 25 years from manufacture date it's not going to be TOO long of a wait. The first ones go back to late '93 IIRC, so that translates into being legal in late 2018.

That being said there ARE a handful(I've heard 15 at this point) that made it here under dubious legality. They do sometimes come up for sale. However, you do run the risk of the feds taking notice and taking the car if you're unlucky. Personally I'm not willing to run that risk, but some are. Expect them to be quite expensive if/when they are sold.

Other things to note are that parts specific to the ST205, specifically brakes and suspension, are going to be almost completely ridiculously difficult to obtain. Engine parts shouldn't be -too- hard to find if needed, but you may have to order from overseas at some points, or at least a specialist shop that stocks parts for people who have swapped to 3rd and 4th-gen 3SGTEs.

My solution? I'm picking up a very clean '165 next week that will eventually have the entire '205 drivetrain swapped over. There's something about the fourth-gen bodystyle that just does it for me.",0

*Seriously* OP? You don't know why you told someone you were flirting with that you were single? You say you don't want to tell your wife because it will hurt her and you don't want to do that. If that's true, and you really do love her, then you need to sit her down and seriously work on getting into counselling (or at the very least talking together) about fixing whatever it is that you feel is wrong with your marriage. Don't make excuses like ""oh well, we just never followed through"". You need to put *effort* in if you want to make it work.


Now, if what you *really* want is to screw around on Tinder then stop telling yourself it's just innocent banter, stop telling yourself there's nothing wrong with what you're doing. Tell your wife the truth and break it off because you aren't do her a favor by staying with her if you're going to be cheating (physically OR emotionally). I get the feeling that this is NOT what you want, and if that's the case you need to stop doing this shit and start being honest with your wife, starting with this (because it's going to be a lot worse if that chick actually does tell her)

"The beauty of CB is the flexibility of the weapon. Have a hammer bro? Go for tail. Have a GS? Go for head to KO. Have both? Go for feet and get trips. You can go for big hits and KOs or you can stay in in sns mode forever with a status CB. Fill whatever role the team needs and you'll be guaranteed better clear times and more broken parts. I try not to overlap because CB is very prone to tripping, but with good positioning, you can easily share a head with hammer if you really need the KO. 

Also a word of caution with GPs, while there are people with the requisite skill, I tend to not use them online unless I'm in a bad spot. It's fine to try to style on the monster solo, but if I miss the GP online, I'll get hit, be in axe mode when I get out, and get hit by a follow up attack because Im too slow. Definitely carted to this many times. Most of the time after you get a GP, you should be looking to evade the next attack since monsters get so aggressive in g rank. Thus, you probably shouldn't have been there in the first place. I try to combo such that it takes me through and past the monster. For example, there's an opening head on, X+A to dash in -&gt; charge A-&gt; X+A-&gt;X+A -&gt; R to charge shield-&gt; evade forward. That should take you all the way through the monster and a good distance behind him. The side evades are great for this too. Where you finish your combo is just as important as when you start and the CB has great tools for this to make up for it's lower walk and sheath speed. Hope that helps and sorry for the long winded answer!",0

Last night there were 3 people at freeweights, and 3 people on shoulder day. 

One guy asked me to share my 7kg DBs which was ok, because he was actually using them first, but also using an incline bench at the smith machine. In the end I used 8kgs because impatient.

Then later when I was using the other incline bench, halfway through my set this other guy non-verbally asked to use the bench, to which I indicated that I was still using it. He then ask ""can share?"". The other guy still had his stuff at the other incline bench. I said ""try lor"", but I kinda knew that I'd be rather inconvenienced by it because I don't take long breaks between sets.

Halfway through 2nd guy's first set, the first guy removed his stuff from other incline bench. So I went and got the other incline bench and used it.

"I am glad that this group notices this.

When I see this article, I sigh because it sucks this guy or group may owe this much in taxes.  I feel sick.  It is organized theft from the government and no one is really pissed about it.  And it actually kind of goes to the absurdity of our progressive personal income tax system.  Pseudo percentage based tax system.


But there are a couple of big issues with taxes.

   *  First, everyone and even some dumb rich people advocate for ... higher taxes on the rich.    Why is this bad?  See my second point.
    * Second, where do taxes go?  They go to the biggest pyramid scheming, mega-corporation, trillion dollar budget, war machine that is our US government.     The US federal government and its reckless spending has reached astronomical heights with zero accountability.    It is kind of shocking and people want to tax more  and give the government more money.

Really, people just want to tax the rich.  That is the goal.  It doesn't matter where the money is going.  They want the rich to have less.  Which is a pretty dumb line of thinking.  Just because you tax the rich doesn't mean you automatically gain.  If you tax Soros 7 billion, doesn't mean you get 50k in your pocket.  It is really a dumb line of thinking and completely irrational.  I hate when people on the ""left"" advocate for higher taxes and don't really say why.  Some might get into the debt and social security costs and all of that, but my response to that is, well what about government spending?  Why don't we NOT spend 600 billion on defense?

All that to say, I don't get mad that people evade taxes.  We should all get pissed that the government machine will take parts of your wealth.  And we don't know what Soros and these rich guys will do with the money.  They were pretty successful, they will probably invest it in another successful firm or project.

"&gt;In that case, why are there incursions?

I think it's because the gradual death of the multiverse via the murders of the Molecule Men is destabilizing reality.

&gt;And if Doom had been able to kill at least a thousand Molecule Men, shouldn't there be at least a thousand universes that survive?

Killing the Molecule Men doesn't save the universes I thought, I thought it killed everything in that universe

&gt;Steve says that Tony knew about it all from the beginning. How does he know this? How did Tony know?

I don't think it's that Tony knew about the origin of the incursions and all that, I thought it meant Tony knew that it was likely they would never be able to stop the incursions

&gt;And when the incursion is imminent, they're preparing for escape as if there was no hope of survival. But isn't it that between 616 and 1610, one of those universes will survive the last incursion?

I think they were basically just preparing for the worst.  After all, the one Earth they fought that actually put up a fight, they got their asses kicked until Dr. Strange went crazy (The Great Society)",0

"+ Tx fees are part of Bitcoin as always, if you are willing to wait a few confirmations more then usual, you can even forego those, since many miners dont care and still process 0 fee transactions. I also see no reason why tx fees will rise anytime in the future, the opposite is the case with rising competition among miners.  
+ Regulation of Bitcoin will happen but only in the sense and scope that already covers all transactions in the legal economy of any jurisdiction. BTC is like digital cash. They can only force you to give up your BTC or transact according to their rules as long as you stay within their ""white"" economy. If you want to hide your BTC, buy stuff the government doesnt want you to or give money to people they dont like, there is nothing they can do to hinder you.   
+ Thats the beauty of Bitcoin: all transactions are visible but nobody knows to whom those txs belong, until you come out and tell them that they belong to you. I you want to stay anonymous, just use one of the many mixers or mixing protocols on top of Bitcoin to completely obfuscate your transactions and no 3 letter agancy can track your finances, as tried and failed by the FBI during the Silk Road 1 bust and their inability to track BTCs in Silk Roads tumbler.

Danny sits there with a blank look and says ""I don't know"". She prompts him again by asking how he gets liquid into his body when he's thirsty. Danny replies, ""I don't know."" She is amazingly frustrated by this point and goes as far to ask ""Danny, how do you get water into your body when you're thirsty?"" and he replies, ""I don't know. Through your skin, maybe?""

She freaks out and loses her shit. He's sitting there looking dazed as always and Mrs. Teacher charges to the back of the room and grabs his arm. She pulls him out of his seat and drags him to the front of the classroom where there was a sink.  The water gets turned on and she shoves his arm into the stream and keeps yelling at him ""Through the skin?? THROUGH THE SKIN!?  How are you feeling now? Are you getting full? Are you getting enough water? YOU DRINK WATER WITH YOUR MOUTH!""

"&gt;without becoming fluent in the native language before hand first but make do with everything being written in English also.

Not from experience.  They tend to have the exact system UKIP is supporting.  When I got my first French tax forms it's all in either French, French, or French.  You pay for other people to do that shit for you if you can't do it.

Somewhat even more bizarrely is the food packaging which generally has several languages on it, but they still often omit English despite it being the prevalent second language across Europe.

The exception is there was an English speaking notaire, but it's not a state sanctioned thing and there's no guarantee of it, rather one of their notaires happens to speak English too - but you have to be prepared to wait longer for an appointment.  No English speaking notaire, then you find somebody to accompany you.  The bank has an English speaking service, but again, the state isn't paying for it.

As far as the state is concerned they expect you to learn, and if you need help it's either you pay or you throw yourself at someone's mercy and hope they do you a solid.

We have the world's most popular second language, the language of international business, science, even airwaves, and an exported  culture that means it is everywhere.  There's no reason why we should be paying for translators.  And now with smartphone technology it's getting easier and easier still.

"Couple things. First, ""E-commerce site"" says pretty much nothing. Amazon is an e-commerce site; so is etsy or ebay or NewEgg. They're vastly different, enterprise-grade challenges.

Second, $5k in the LA area is not that much money. You have to figure that ""Knows what they're doing"" *starts* about a $50 an hour and ideally goes for around double that. For agencies -the walls which talent is hidden behind- easily goes for 50%-100%+ *that* amount. A $5k budget won't even show up on their radar. 

The best way to save money, or to operate with a $5k budget, is to construct a ""fill in the blank"" website. This is the usual route of WordPress plus pick a theme which suits you then tweak and launch. Alternatively, of course, you could look for overseas talent at places like odesk. 

For what it's worth, I regularly talk to business owners in the LA area and technical talent is always the hardest to find. While a pile of resumes is just a craigslist ad away, finding business grade developers is another story, for which there are only a handful. 

I would recommend attending some of the numerous developer/designer gatherings which occur in the LA area and meeting them. You have to consider that developers in demand are choosy about their clients -they generally don't respond to craigslist- so it helps to shake hands in person and convince them you would be an awesome client.

"In FE 9 more or less everyone is useable do to bexp and weapon forges. So you can go through the game and just use who ever you like with no problems. There is the big 5 though which is Marcia, Titania, Oscar, Jill and Kieran who are the best units in FE9 for the most part. I will say Zihark is pretty cool, but he isn't to great in the scheme of things in FE9. Worst unit though would probably be Rolf though if you don't count Bastian and Lucia.

Just use them to patch up the units your using or get some going. Though in FE9 people like saving all of them for the last chapter to make sure they get the transfers they want for RD. PoR isn't a hard game at all and you wont need to use them.

Yeah only 1 support between a pair per chapter. 

Depends. Statistically units will be stronger if they get to 20 unpromoted. Though promoting early isn't to bad in a lot of cases. Healers are staffed locked and have pretty terrible exp gains so they will level up slowly which makes 20 unpromoted take a long time. There is also the promo bonuses which can cover for the lost of a few levels in some cases. Also the move boost that units get is pretty great and may warrant an early promotion on that alone. But it is your playstyle and you can promote whenever you feel like it.",0

"Yeah, it looks like this is the root script that triggers all other scripts upon 100% completion.

Those scripts show the UFOs, and do things like ensure that when you get close in a vehicle, a force is applied to push you away.  It also makes sure the special ""evil death ray"" audio (as they call it) gets played.

It also seems that this triggers UFO_EYE, which is the special script that has a conditional ambient zone for the 3rd UFO, the one above the mountain.  That has it's own script because it only triggers when you get close enough, and in the right conditions.

There is no ambient zone or script for the sunken UFO as it seems to be just a model and nothing more.

- Sanitation: Dead bodies are disgusting to us because they can spread disease

- Predation prevention: Dead bodies will attract predators to the camp, endangering the living members

- Religious: Since early humans didn't just dump someone in a hole to bury them (they were laid down in a particular way, often accompanied with tools/weapons/artifacts), it is believed that they had the primitive belief in an afterlife, so there was a ceremony associated with burying the dead, potentially also burying those valuable assets thinking they would need it later.",0

"Yeah, it comes with 10 of them in yellow. It also a cool synth because it teaches you to let go - did a patch, had fun with it, and then you reset everything to make something new. Because of this it actually encourages experimentation. 

Its inability to store patches is also its main drawback as it makes for a poor stage synth - you can only use it for one sound during your performance. Even though I've seen many big name artists use original ones on stage many people people ""grow out"" of them and move on to more advanced digital or digitally controlled synths. 

Here are some actually some cool tips for it, which also show additional capabilities of the thing: https://youtu.be/jglbXy2tN20?list=PL2Y43eupOAVWhx_1j_VdvpYArHulB0c7m

Here is an official Korg demo that shows that it also can sound smooth: https://youtu.be/fSnzCWA_JWI

Another thing to mention: You seem fairly new to this synth game. So I just wanted to point out that many times synths are being paired with reverb and delay, just like in the video you found. It gives them more body and spaciousness. If you'll find your synth sounding ""stale"" and you use an amp you can also get a Zoom MS-70CDR pedal which features decent emulations of many popular effects.

Just don't get fixed on effects pedals and shit. A proper synth can actually fake many of them. Or more like a good synth programmer can. Just focus on learning synthesis and you will achieve great results. Don't worry if you can get good or memorable sounds out of your synth at first - it will come with experience. And don't think you've reached the limits of the synth - there is always more.

PS: As an example of a latter statement, I got my hands on one of them Volca Keys synths and to me it seemed more like a toy - a very simple and limited synth. I thought: not much can be done with it. And then: https://youtu.be/0WpZZjy8MkU, https://youtu.be/__C4pICe83U and https://youtu.be/GYLRtWk9wgE.",0

"G1 - You don't scout the spire. You don't go up to *at least* 6 gates initially after expanding (7-10 if you're not teching at all; normally you'd go up to at least 6-8 if you're focusing on tech, or 8-10 if you're making a whole bunch of stalkers). You don't do a poke to force units upon seeing nothing but drones early on and your blink is very late because of opened stargate. Normally, I expand off of 3 gate + forge with 6-8 sentries when I do this build, no stargate. You can do a stargate opener, but the proxy makes it harder to defend against mutas too. You need to scout and have a response to mutas, be it phoenixes or a gateway attack with blink behind it.


G3 - You're trying to do a weird blink all in, expect... you're actually not doing an all in at all. That's too many gates if you're going to take a third. You should take quick third if you're not doing an all in and you just want to go blink sentry. What I do is go zealot, go up to 3 gates while making sentries nonstop, double gas at natural, forge, then move out once warp gate finished to take a third with a whole bunch of sentries and +1 attack behind it. You make a cannon, then add 3+ gates and a twillight council. You can go up to 7-10 gates if you want more blink stalkers, or stay on 6 gates and add a robo, then go up to 8 gates after you move out and then 10 gates later. Watch this vod if you want to see the build in more detail, I stole it from top pros like herO and Rain, but this is basically the same. http://www.teamliquid.net/forum/sc2-strategy/481008-french-pvz-guide


By the way, I think you need storm earlier against zerg. You're playing a turtle style with non late game units, which isn't that good. I recommend attacking more often to see if you can snipe their 4th and stuff, relying on force fields and recall to stay safe. Then constantly send hallucinated phoenixes and if you see roach hydra + hive tech, tech to storm asap imo.",0

"Basically if they flick instantaneously and get a headshot, and *return* their aim to where they were originally, ya gots a hacker.

And I'm talking instantaneous. Like, they're aiming somewhere, flick immediately and lock onto to someone's head in 1 frame, shoot, and return their aim in the next frame. If a sniper takes even a measureable amount of time to flick onto target, they're probably legit, solely because most hacks aren't programmed with a delay between flicking and landing a headshot.

And the spectate system in TF2 is really weird. You'll see a sniper aim very obviously below or above someone's head, but they'll get a headshot. From my understanding, this is because the server doesn't show you exactly where people are aiming when scoped, but show you a rough approximation. 

Lag does come into play as well. If you see someone shoot where the target *used* to be, and they score a headshot, they're lagging a bit. (this is actually how people regularly headshot you around corners).",0

"&gt; Honestly, I have never heard any say it.

I believe you that you haven't heard it, although I have definitely heard it.  And among the general public this is said almost constantly.  If you're looking for me to go combing through 30+ years of various politicians' speeches and remarks, I'll just be honest: I'm not doing that for the sake of a random internet discussion.  If you think it's worth digging, be my guest. [**EDIT**: although see my comment [here](http://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/34ffo5/what_one_sentence_can_someone_say_to_make_you/cqulldd) for a couple of examples that I found without trouble.]  The point is that is that it's not as if people haven't heard this message.  That message is there.  MY point is that addressing these things you list, just by themselves, are not *enough*.  And it's far more complicated than ""don't have kids.""  Birth control is a pretty significant factor, and on that score it's not even as simple as ""don't have sex."" 

Maybe you've gotten the impression that liberals are a-okay with all those problems.  They're not, at all.  The difference is that (some) liberals recognize them as symptoms of broader issues.  And many of those broader issues are the result of long term policies which were put in place or are maintained out of racism.  That's the ""legacy"" people are always going on about.  So what's wrong with addressing those problems, too?  My concern here is that you seem to be saying those other things don't exist.
 
Now, our disagreement *should be* over how to address these systemic issues.  As a conservative, I'm sure you're against government programs that attempt to tackle poverty (and depending on the program, I might be too).  But I should think that you'd support means of ensuring more sensible sentencing, of reforming police departments whose behavior lead to eruptions like Baltimore and Ferguson and so on, etc.  ",0

"Despite what many think, the story of Civil War isn't about secret identities. Few key Marvel characters actually maintain a strict secret identity in the modern era. Many, like Cap, abandoned them years ago. The story *is* about the changing views of the audience, traditional superhero characters and stories versus modern tastes and sensibilities.

Prior to the Standford incident, superheroes were largely unofficially recognized by local, state, or federal government. Vigilantism is technically illegal, especially in a manner most superheroes (be they Marvel or DC) carry themselves. And they also commit crimes like assault, battery, and even criminal confinement.

We the audience and many people in the stories accept this as part of superheroics. Cops let the behavior slide because it is seen as a benefit to society. But the Stanford incident changed perception of this behavior in the Marvel U.

Tony understood the changing political climate and predicted that the populace would not tolerate traditional superheroics any longer. His support and leadership of the Registration Act was the logical evolution of heroes in this new world. It would allow heroes to do what they do best, but in an official capacity the people they claim to want to protect approve of. It was a necessary change that had to happen.

Cap, however, stood against it as a matter of personal rights and freedoms being attacked. That traditional ways were working just fine and one incident should not change this. His realization and surrender at the end of the story is rooted in how he finally realized that he was wrong. That he and his supporters were being rather selfish in their war.

Tony fought for change and the desires of the people. Cap and his team were fighting against change for their own selfish views and wants. The needs of the many versus the needs of the few.

Of course, the resulting infighting and chaos proved to be the end goal of the Skrull faction who wanted to weaken the bonds of the superhero community in order to successfully invade and conquer Earth. But this hardly changes the personal views of characters like Tony and Steve.",0

Why? Because if this situation were reversed - women CEOs being paid 68c on the dollar compared to their male counterparts, everybody would be yapping on about gender inequality and how it's still unfair that they get paid less. I'm baffled.

Edit: The point of this post was to show Reddit's dichotomy, I have no idea if the claim being made in the original article is any more valid or invalid than the reverse claim that women make 77c on the dollar.

**So here is Episode 2 of Shitty MAL Reviews**!

**Review #1: [Mekakucity Actors](http://myanimelist.net/anime/21603/Mekakucity_Actors) (TV)**

&gt; Ah, Mekakucity Actors (or Kagerou Project). I will try my best not to spoil anything.
&gt; 
&gt; To be honest, it took me multiple tries to actually get past the first couple minutes of the first episode. From that I saw a cliche shut-in talking to his computer bug. But then I actually kept watching.
&gt; 
&gt; I struggled through the first five episodes. I found the characters unoriginal and boring. But then a certain side-story-flashback-thing occupied episode six and seven. I was like, ""Oh, it's that anime!"" And then episode eight happened. At first I was so, and I mean SOOOOOO, confused. But then I thought about it a bit, and it wasn't that confusing anymore.
&gt; 
&gt; **Story: 9**

&gt; The story gets a 9 because it was original-er than I expected, and I didn't have low expectations. The reason it didn't get a 10 is because it was so rushed and confusing.
&gt; 
&gt; **Art: 9**

&gt; The art also deserves a 10, but the reason it didn't get it was because it's kind of a particular art style. It's like, you like it or you hate it.
&gt; 
&gt; **Sound: 10**

&gt; The music was awesome. The voice actors were impressive. (Marry's scream at the end!)
&gt; 
&gt; **Character: 10**

&gt; While in the beginning the characters seemed stereotypical and boring, by the last episode, I was impressed with the amount of development each one's personality had.
&gt; 
&gt; Overall, I did really enjoy this anime.

**Review #2: [Mahouka Koukou no Rettousei](http://myanimelist.net/anime/20785/Mahouka_Koukou_no_Rettousei) (TV)**



&gt; its just a bull shit
&gt; the whole anime (dropped at ep 15)
&gt; 
&gt; **plot 210**
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; 1.the mc - bla bla bla iam weak iam weak cause i cant move a wooden block!
&gt; its doesnt even matter that i can cancle people magic(without super tec like every normal ""magician""), can fly (no one can),

&gt; 2.the mc is the best enginer in the world (heard about something that cannot figure out how to do in 20 years, makes it possible in half a day)

&gt; 3.to obvius that he would always win they didnt even try to make the battle looks like he have no chance (not like u have some battles most of the anime its usless talk)

&gt; 4.80% of the episods they just explain u wats happend but no one rly care about it its just to booring honestly (i watched (Zetsuen no Tempest) and this anime is perfect and its have a conversation about 3 episodes in a row,but Zetsuen no Tempest have an idea of something real u can imagining it by ur self u ur self can think about it and say its rly are a nice idea but...).
&gt; in this magic anime the whole idea is a shit and they every f*cking episode trying to explain u wats happened he used magic left then down and he knokout him like that then some imaginary magic power interfere with some electricity vibrathion and he got knok out the whole anime and always the same
&gt; the mc heard about flying magic (they said all the sienciest in the world trying to figure it out for years)
&gt; he goes home make some shit and in the evening he can fly GG plot best plot ever
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; **characters 210**
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; u the main characters is the super boy and his sister
&gt; the story foces only them to show us how perfect they are as long as i saw till ep 15 u got nothing new about them u just can see more and more how much they are good and perfect and every one else suck...
&gt; the other characters side are just noisence u also didnt rly get their story and they are relevent only to show as the differences between the mc and their power the mc always win agains them he always the best in every way...
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; **music 810**
&gt; 
&gt; i dont rly care about the sound so that just fine
&gt; 
&gt; **animation 810**
&gt; 
&gt; the animation style is also normal
&gt; nothing special
&gt; 
&gt; **enjoyment 310**
&gt; 
&gt; honestly i just make my self watch it
&gt; 
&gt; **total 310**
&gt; 
&gt; so if u wanna anime that only talk 90% then the mc make some ""magic"" and win in instant go a head its for u... the only reason i didnt droped that earlier is cause i tough maybe it would go better but i tought so on ep 4 then in 10 and i got sick of it and dropped it at ep 15
&gt; 
&gt; btw why is that tag as romance as long as i saw ep 15 i onlly saw sister complex with her brother if that a romance so oh shit nigga wtf?

"Again, you seem confused about what 'lying' means. It isn't 'statement that I can't disprove' or 'statement that disproves my argument'. 

For example, a lie would be 'they only care about GG style free speech'. Given the amount of time they spend mocking GG, that one is particularly hilarious. I'm going to assume you've never seen any of their discussions with Milo Yiannopolous (sp?) or the GG guy who wanted to sue Blockbot? Both of those, by the way, directly contradict your assertion. So does the blog post that they wrote about GG - https://popehat.com/2014/10/26/ten-short-rants-about-gamergate/

The really funny part of this is that you argue just like a Gamergater- or a Republican yelling about Benghazi.

"Amiibos are physical figurines that you can [buy from retail stores](https://www.nintendo.com/amiibo).

On the title screen of Hyrule Warriors, you can place an Amiibo on the bottom-left corner of your Wii U Game Pad to receive a free gift. You can scan up to 5 Amiibos per day.

* Link Amiibo / Toon Link Amiibo: Unlocks Link’s Spinner weapon. Subsequent uses will give you a Link weapon with 3+ stars.
* Zelda Amiibo: Gives you a Zelda weapon with 3+ stars.
* Sheik Amiibo: Gives you a Sheik weapon with 3+ stars.
* Ganondorf Amiibo: Unknown as of this date, but presumably, it should give you a Ganondorf weapon with 3+ stars.
* Other Amiibos: Gives you Rupees, Materials, or a random weapon.

Normally, the Zelda-related Amiibos will grant you a rank 3 weapon for that specific character. However, Amiibos cannot grant you weapons you have not unlocked. For example, if you have a Sheik Amiibo, and you’ve only unlocked Sheik’s rank 2 weapon (Typhoon Harp), you will only receive Typhoon Harps from your Sheik Amiibo. You must unlock Sheik’s rank 3 weapon (Triforce Harp) from the Adventure Map before your Sheik Amiibo can give you Triforce Harps.

And if you haven’t unlocked Zelda, Sheik, or Ganondorf as characters, their corresponding Amiibos will give you a random prize as if they were a normal Amiibo.

You receive an ingame Medal for scanning 100 Amiibos called the Amiibo Warriors Medal.",0

"I drive an R53 MINI Cooper S that I bought when it was 9 years old, well maintained, low mileage, paid cash. Not entirely the most economical decision as they have middle of the road reliability and middle of the road fuel economy, but as a car enthusiast it would pain me to drive something like a Honda Fit. The MINI represents a nice balance between driver's car and economy car considering the supercharger, brilliant steering feel, racing competitiveness, and passable fuel efficiency. I also work on my own car and like to tinker, so the car is relatively cheap to maintain and relatively cheap to modify for a bit more power. In the end, I couldn't be happier even though I spent a few extra bucks, but recognize that this was a worthwhile trade off for me whereas it may not have been for others with different skill sets and interests.

That said, I have always driven enthusiast cars bought used that were well maintained. I usually drive them for a year or so and then sell them.

"Well according to [this polling data](http://www.gallup.com/poll/164618/desire-children-norm.aspx), the desire to have kids hasn't changed all that much in recent years.  I'd wager most people's anecdotal experience skews their perception of how many people wanted kids from their youth.

Remember, when you (or anyone) was growing up, you were almost wholly surrounded by people who wanted to be surrounded by kids.  You didn't see many of the people that didn't want kids because they did not want to be around you.  That can create a false perception that a disproportionate amount of people want to have kids eventually.

When you reach adulthood, you see all the people that don't want kids because they aren't actively avoiding you anymore.  That could account for some of the perceived change.

"I like the concept of roleplay/daydream/characterplay a lot. That way  I can kind of act out some of the abuse that occurred to me and then release it. I have a stuffed animal that I talk to. In a way, this stuffed animal has always been a surrogate parent. It's one of the few things I've always had from my childhood. This animal I think, embodies the things that I never had. I also sometimes go into character in games with characters that represent the ways I've suffered. Either they have no parents, or abusive parents, or they have some kind of physical scars to represent the abuse they suffered at the hands of their guardians, or their only friend is an animal or they talk to animals better than people. Since one of my main problems is eye-related (from the fact I never had eye surgery as a child because my parents are so cheap - its called amplyopia and stigmatism as well as I have a lot of floaters from the stress- imagine lots of different sized grains always floating in front of your vision) one of my characters is half-blind...it sort of helps me embody it I think.

I should add that they may want to throw a shower once baby is born to meet your little person since you're a decent distance away. Maybe slide it into casual conversation that

"Mostly right, few minor clarifications.  Most asphalt roads don't have concrete underneath, BOC (Bituminous over concrete) is actually kinda rare, and nearly always a retrofit to an in place concrete road in need to work, as it is far cheaper than a full reconstruct or concrete overlay.  Decisions on pavement structure are actually super complicated.  Anyway the base of most roadways is aggregate, aggregate is actuality a really strong material in thick enough layers.  

Another repair that can be used is mud jacking.  A hole is drilled through the pavement down to the cavity under the pavement.  Grout is pumped into the voids repairing the structure.  The pavement can then be patched and a overlay to improve the ride.  

Pavement repair in general is actually pretty complicated and constantly evolving field.

I have heard of hair texture changing as you age, but going from straight to curly must be a huge adjustment.  My sister's is doing that a bit; she's gone from straight to increasing waviness in the past 3 or 4 years (she's 35 now) even though she's let it get longer and longer.

"You got legitimate points, but I don't agree with your conclusion of what our reaction should be.

It is not guilt tripping or taking for granted to be our obligation. That's only if we want to interpret it that way.

The point is to realize that we are all small players under a bigger power. Even if we have beef with each other, it will be against our interests to not align and at least provide some minimal support. Normal rules of reciprocating revenge does make sense here. Normally, when someone is bad towards us, we will be bad towards them. But that's only for a game with equal players. Now is a game with skewed players, so the reciprocating revenge rules should be suspended or applied less.

Even if it doesn't instantaneously benefit us, an unexpected support will benefit us more because it won't cost us anything, it will generate positive value for someone else who have some set of interests aligned with us, so that we might get a return somewhere down the line. With more of these exchange, we might establish a symbiotic group relationship that will make us both stronger and equalize the game for us.",0

More broadly, talking about averages with a set like salaries is only useful at the collective level, and largely meaningless at the level of individuals.

Try this on: The average salary in MLS is higher than the J-League, but the average J-league player earns more than the average MLS player.

Can that be true?

Yes, and I think it actually *is* true. DPs in MLS skew the average up, so while the average in MLS might be higher than the J-League, the median in the J-League might be higher than MLS.

Is a statement, you probably disagree.

In a debate it'd be my job to convince you. By stating my opinion I am not convincing you unless you share my perspective, as stated I didn't share it. I wanted his sources which allowed him to come to his conclusion so I can re-evaluate myself.

The danger of having to do your own research based on the opinions of others is your own inherent bias effecting how you respond to it. The evidence which convinced them should help convince or at the very least self-question.

Another danger is my opinion, a part of me, something which Google knows about so if the thing is up for debate I will receive sources I WANT, not the sources I should find.

And finally, the reason I prefer getting a source is the additional depth. We have opinions on facts, regardless of their absoluteness we all have different opinions many of which are far too long on complex to type out, by posting the sources and further reading if a replier is truly interested in debate they can see my expanded viewpoint easily with a well researched backing to better explain why I feel this way.

For example.

I believe 9/11 was an inside job.

Now firstly, if you Googled that you'd get a miriad of different websites claiming different things with different sources and more importantly a casm of differing definitions of inside job and to the extent and level. Now you could find backing up, but you're opinion wouldn't change because of the variety and your own personal bias which already knows such a thing exsists.

Now if I where to state my opinion in-depth with facts and sources backing up that exact position you'd get a better picture of my perspective allowing you to participate in a debate in which we can convey our own conclusions and the underlying evidence behind them. Hopefully with one of us changing their perspective.

If you did your own personal research you'd find plenty of sources but highly doubt you'd come to the same conclusion and certainly wouldn't change your perspective.

SO I want you to discredit my first statement about Britain rebuilding an empire. You can't provide your source and you must research mine.

I also have to agree with the other commenter about seizures changing you.  A seizure can cause damage to your brain, and to allow that to happen simply to avoid the process of finding effective medications could potentially be a large mistake.

**1st point: I agree. MLS players are not valued a high as others and the global market reflects that. What I took from the Twitter post was less about global market value, and more about how much money a team was willing/allowed to invest in players.
**
That's really what drives the global market too right? As Barca, Real Madrid, Man U, Bayern, etc. battle it out for a GREAT player, his price will rise. 

So if a MLS team was willing/allowed to invest more money into its players, they could have more players with a higher perceived value (like what if the All-Star team was a team). The hope being that this would improve their overall quality and depth. 

**Tangent**: I'm not against this, I do worry that it would unbalance the teams and make the league less enjoyable overall, but that's just based on my personal viewing preference. But it would help in some of these international competitions...

**2nd point**: Yes. Higher salaries like those of CEOs and DPs will always naturally skew a figure higher when talking about Averages and it should always be questioned when someone presents you with such a figure. ",0

"I'm not disagreeing with your sentiment, but I think *Isma* is giving an accurate account of her faith.   Under Catholicism you can't just say something is so because *you* think it is so.  

If you take it out of the *gay marriage* context, I think you will understand and maybe even appreciate Catholic sentiment.  As an example, the Parliament of England by [Act of Supremacy](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acts_of_Supremacy) declared Henry VIII head of the Church of England.  I think most people probably already know the story, and how it was just a ploy to allow Henry to annul his marriage with Catherine so he could marry Anne Boleyn.  *Saint* Thomas More was canonized (at least partly) because he would not take the Oath of Supremacy, believing Parliament had no jurisdiction over issues which were God's alone.  More said,  ""no temporal man may be the head of the spirituality."" He was beheaded.  The significance is that secular authority has no power over spiritual authority.",0

Sadly, living at home doesn't free me from socially conservative parents.

"&gt; how is it that the German car manufacturers there have been so slow to go electric?

They probably know the German market.

My first guess is the population density in Germany compared to the US. It's 226 per km² or 583 per square mile in contrast to 34.2 per km² (88.6 per square mile) in the US. As a consequence, most people live in urban environments, ie. flats. It's hard to put solar on your roof when you don't own the roof. Charging at home becomes a problem when your car has no fixed parking space.

My second guess is the vacation culture. Our annual vacations are kind of a big deal here where tons of people drive down to Italy, or Spain in the summer. Many of them use their own car. This is important for them, so range anxiety might be higher than in the US.

My third guess is an established car nut culture. There was once a test of car dealers with researchers pretending to be potential buyers asking for hybrids or electric cars. In the better cases, the sales men were ignorant. In the worst cases, they spread lies and falsehoods. Also, journalists in established magazine like Auto Motor Sport are sometimes skeptical about electric cars, to put it mildly.

Finally, from my personal point of view, the Model S may look awesome from the outside, but the interior is a bit too much like a US car, and these do not have have a very good reputation here.

So, hybrids are currently a better bet for car makers. ",0

"It's not a strawman at all, you just don't seem to have actually thought out where your line of reasoning can lead or how it's related. You can claim there's 'obviously a difference' all you want, you are still using the same line of reasoning to completely invalidate what someone has to say based on some arbitrary checklist. The only kind of person who really doesn't need a say in this is someone who doesn't play games. This is a gaming-only problem. They can have a say if they want but it's going to be completely uninformed (unless they inexplicably read gaming sites/magazines despite not playing games). Anyone who plays games though should have every bit the same chance as anyone else in gaming to have their opinion judged by its merits and not because they don't meet arbitrary standards of being a 'modding community member'. 

Edit: I should clarify, I'm not saying being someone who plays games means you will undoubtedly be informed of the situation but at least concerns about it would be valid compared to concerns from someone who has absolutely zero stake in it because they don't play games and the situation is not posed to present any change to any systems outside of games.

&gt; Or things like ""mods always have been free and should be free!"" which is likely because they themselves don't want to pay for them. 

Which is a valid opinion. The fact that you're treating it like it's not is pretty disturbing. Almost as disturbing as implying that not rating or donating makes them 'not part of the community'. 

&gt;As for Valve's reasoning for pursuing this possibility, neither you nor I know that, and to credit it to the dude that clicked the ""download"" link on a couple pages on Nexus Mods seems overly generous in my opinion.

Economics 101. If it didn't look like a viable and highly profitable venture then a company like Valve wouldn't be touching it. Seeing the number of downloads and attaching a dollar sign to it is the catalyst for things like paid mods happening. You think their exorbitantly high cut was just to cover server and hosting costs? Hell no, they saw great potential for profit because modding is a populous and thriving community. ",0

"I'm not sure whether morality plots nicely along a continuum, i'd say it's very complicated. Even if you reject intention and only consider outcomes.
I think what you mean is that the amount of suffering could be plotted along a continuum, but this gets quite complicated as we all can struggle at times when deciding which harm is worse than others.
Took me a while to understand your last sentence. You're saying that not only should [we] make the choice to eat the best thing possible at present, but we can also seek the best.
Yep that's fair, I didn't mean to imply that your framework didn't support constant improvement, I only meant to point out that it's unlikely in this economy (dominated by capitalism) that say grain production will ever evolve to be farmed veganically if we stop eating it all together and get our calories form say honey (ignore the details of the simplification).

But I think my point still stands that under your framework you are obliged to find and locate the best minimal set (can include variety as long as they are of the same level) of nutritionally complete calorie sources and only consume that.

Doesn't really seem that practical as each local[e] will have a different set depending on which crops they can grow etc. There will also be differing opinions about what's healthy.
That's why veganism isn't just a philosophy, political statement, but also comes with guidelines to make it easy to follow practically.
We simply can't have a cohesive baseline under your framework, imagine how much dissent there would be at a potluck. :P",0

"I got this sump as part of a good deal for a few tanks and stands from a friend who couldn't keep them anymore.  

It has got a small protein skimmer (big enough for my tank) built in.  I'm torn between setting up a 37g reef using this sump tank (If I can ever find a replacement tank that fits this stand…) and just getting one of the 29g biocubes where everything is contained in the back of the tank.

Obviously the biocube sounds a lot easier, but I don't mind some extra work.  Hell, I already own the sump tank, so I'd really like to use it because I know they aren't exactly cheap and I don't want to waste it.  Of course I could just save it for when I have room for a bigger tank...  

My options for my first reef tank are pretty much the following:

1) buy new glass, a pump, bio media, and plumbing for the sump.  (I'd love a bigger tank but a 29-40g would be about all I can fit in my apartment.)

or

2) just go for the 29g biocube where all of the filtration is built in.

It will cost close to the same to go either way.  I just can't decide if it's worth trying to make what I already have work or just doing with something entirely different.

I'll admit I'm very new to saltwater and reef keeping.  I've always been a freshwater guy.  Will i significantly benefit from using the sump in my setup if I'm willing to put in the work to make sure everything is proper?",0

"&gt; On the other hand I would like to point out an aspect about this story and its relation to time. Does it have to refer to the state of beings way back then?

Joseph Campbell exposed me to this very idea: that the Garden exists not *out there* in some past geographical location, but within each and everyone of us. And though the Bible narrative tells us we are forever expelled, I believe this is a test, and if we can overcome the fear of losing these meaningless labels, we can return to the Garden anytime and experience a state of pure Being. This is what being present is all about. The Power of Now is there for all of us to grasp, at will, if only with a little practice :)

And your point about children is spot on. I have two of my own and watching them grow and develop has really helped me understand some fundamentals. For instance, the illusion of time. My oldest is five and if I tell her to wait fifteen minutes, she just barely understands what that means. Every two minutes she asks me, ""Is it time yet?"" Time--or clock time, at least--is learned. Which means it doesn't ""exist"" in any meaningful way. Same with all these labels! My youngest pulls hair, hits, pinches, and laughs her little face off. She isn't concerned with ""right"" or ""wrong,"" she's simply testing out cause and effect. 

&gt; We put this grid over nature, and then we label each square so that we can tell ourselves that we know something about it.

I still think there is a purpose and need for this. The problem arises when we forget that the grid isn't real, just a tool for navigating and manipulating Reality. They are useful but not necessary, and they certainly aren't rigid or concrete. Even so, there are patterns in the dance of matter and energy, of ever-shifting forms, and we have the ability to pick out these patterns, analyze and learn from them, and in this the human animal--however you define it--is unique.

It's a hobby we both share. Sadly, because of Nintendo and it's attitude for Amiibo, I nor my brother are able to get amiibo we most want, Ike being one that my brothers want and Shulk the one I want (My dick friend bought a $30 Shulk from Amazon fully knowing that I wanted him and couldn't get him, he gloated about it for a week and is now gloating about his greninja). All the amiibo I have I bought with my own money (I used to work in a pizzaria shop because my father was good friends with the owner but they recently closed so I dont have a job anymore) I got extremely lucky with my unicorns (they were hidden behind some skylanders in Walmart), my parents are Mexican so they don't give a damn about my obsession with amiibo, heck they don't care about my hobbies, they also will NOT buy me anything that is video game related, I had to save up for everything(me and my sister together saved up for a Wii U). I was lucky with Captain Falcon, he was super cheap ($15) on Amazon and I bought him without my dad's permission. He got pissed but not too pissed. Either way, I just spent my last 60 dollars on wave 4 for me and my brother, didn't have enough for Charizard or Wario that was money I saved up for splatoon but both me and my brother wanted the new wave. Again, my chances of winning is slim but in the rare case you pick me, my brother would like the Ike and give the WFT to someone who really wants it. Again I really appreciate you for doing this giveaway, it always gives me a bit of hope in my heart.

I saw the movie in a true IMAX experience at the Henry Ford in Michigan. I couldn't understand half the dialogue and it really bothered me. For example when TARS makes his first joke during launch. Some of the theater laughed and I thought I missed something. This happened a lot during loud portions of the movie. I bought the Bluray and on my sound bar I heard so much great dialogue. A lot of other people told me the same so  thought maybe my theater screwed up the sound levels somehow. Now I read your post. 

Why would Nolan want me to see it in the theater, but not hear the dialogue?

Biggest question of the night: Where is Leon Sandcastle going?,0
"The same reason why people aren't overreacting to Mariota's 2 INTs. I guess teams think each QB's performances were all about the kind of system they were in.

We saw Foles run a similar system as Mariota/Oregon in the NFL and finish with only 2 INTs one season, but the next season his INT count was much higher. Teams know that if they run a spread system similar to what Mariota was in, they probably aren't going to see his insane TD-INT ratio because NFL defenses have rapidly evolved.

Now take a look at Winston. Teams know what to expect from him because he was in a true pro system, and he finished with 25 TDs to 18 INTs. Which means teams are probably expecting roughly the same kind of performance in his rookie NFL season. If he does have 25-18 again, that would put him in a very similar range as the rookie seasons of Luck, Wilson, and Dalton - all three of which led their teams to playoff appearances.",0

"The day my mother died suddenly, I found out that both she and my dad had been married before. On top of this, the ""cousin"" that used to come visit us when I was a child was actually my half-sister! She had stopped coming around, but I always liked her and wished she would come back. Sad part is, even my father had lost track of his own daughter (long story involving the secret they were keeping from me, a marriage and subsequent move and then divorce of my half-sister) and he hadn't able to locate her for years. Happy ending - 18 years after my mom's death, my sister contacts me out of the blue, we meet up for a tearful reunion, and shortly afterwards, father and daughter are reunited at last! We all love each other dearly and love to get together (we each live in different states.)  ",0

"I enjoyed the movie but didn't like how Ultron was handled. At the beginning, Ultron came across as a really intimidating villain. By the end, he just became a walking punchline (a la Loki in Avengers). Getting beat up by Hulk mid-sentence and having him defeated by a single member of the Avengers kind of negated any of the tension the film had built up surrounding the character.

Also, kind of disappointed with how Quicksilver was outed. Bit lame.

Besides these two things I quite enjoyed it, though I think it's inferior to the first.

"I think this is common in long distance relationships when there is no end in sight to the 'long distance' part. From your post, it sounds like you are thinking about this relationship as a potential permanent partnership rather than as something more casual/just for fun. The scary thing about that is that means you're a ways away from your goal in the relationship--a long-term commitment. If it doesn't feel like you're progressing toward that goal, that can make you question the relationship. Your relationship might seem stagnant right now. It sounds like the two of you have reached a point where you are very emotionally intimate, so that part of your relationship isn't developing much over time anymore. Because you're in an open-ended LDR, your relationship also isn't developing much physically or in terms of practical commitments (""after I finish school, we'll move together to city X,"" etc.).

""Cops wouldn't do that,"" ""I wouldn't do that,"" ""yeah going alone is a great idea,"" and other thoughts like these are common reactions to typical horror flicks because writers have to come up with ways of getting people into strange circumstances. 


That, and the fact that they have a more easily achievable albeit ""cheap"" way of giving audiences the indented thrills. You can't get tears without some serious emotional connection to the story, but you can ""scare"" the shit out of someone at ANY time with fast cuts and loud noises.

"&gt; Your response to my point that Christianity has done good things as well as bad things was the point out bad things Christianity has done.  In other words, you just repeated the same argument again without addressing my criticism.

The fact that Christianity has done good as well as bad is of little relevance here. This particular law is an example of one of the bad things Christianity has done because it is a transparent attempt to make it as difficult as possible for a woman to exercise her right to bodily autonomy. 

&gt; You suggest that Satanism is a sincere religion.  You might have a point here, though I doubt their very specific alleged belief that waiting periods are against their region for abortions is sincere.

I assure you the members are very sincere. The third tenet of The Satanic Temple is ""One's body is inviolable, subject to one's own will alone"". This is taken very seriously. When the state imposes completely unnecessary obstacles to obtaining a legal abortion for the sole purpose of discouraging the free exercise of that right, with no other basis than the personal beliefs of the Christian majority in the state, it is a gross violation of her religious belief of the inviolability of her bodily autonomy. The Satanic Temple is not a stunt, it is not a vehicle for shock value, it is not a mockery of religion like some other organizations are. It is a religion with principles that are held dear by its members. ",0

You think trans people aren't insecure? A trans girl in a girls lockerroom would be very insecure and probably keep to themselves more than a lesbian.

"&gt;Equating being transgender with having autism is a potentially nasty implication. 

Erm, why?  Is there something bad or shameful about being on the autism spectrum?  There's nothing ""nasty"" about having faced additional struggles in life

&gt;Minor point, but what you've just described is a very extreme situation. Trans people that 'sensitive' are definitely in the minority. 

Really?  It's my understanding that people transition because they have suicidal thoughts and literally cannot live outside of the gender role they're transitioning to.  It's not some cosmetic thing, they're doing it to make the pain go away because they've determined that the pain comes from not looking and dressing a certain way.

It's easy to be grateful and nice whenever you're being approached by people who love you for what you've created and who only want to express their love of that work. It would take a special kind of asshole to not act favorably toward those people.

"&gt; Sensitive to that, not necessarily overly sensitive. ""Sensitive"" is used dismissively a whole lot, but if you apply it equally people aren't willing to call their offense by that same measure.

In the context of the question, ""sensitive"" can mean ""generally sensitive"" or ""sensitive to that"". I am on the side that it meant ""sensitive to that"", but I can understand how people could have read it as ""generally sensitive"". However, I see no way that it implies ""overly sensitive"" or it used the word sensitive to be dismissive.

"Unfortunately, all of my friends who play Smash either have the 3ds version or don't play competitively. Or both. So I have to resort to online, but even then, I can't find one. It won't make anything different, I already KNOW what I have to work on and idk why people keep telling me to watch for what I should work on. I'd LOVE to get better at my neutral game with spot dodges or whatever needs to be done, but time doesn't work for me. At all. 

I'll give you an example. Before Smash 4, I never shielded. Like, ever. I just rolled. However, someone told me that shielding is a good option for defense, and so I just did so all the time because it was a press of a button. However, this now leads me to a shielding habit and I get grabbed a lot(I'm also not good at perfect shielding because that requires reaction time and I'm not very good at that). So now I have to learn to spot dodge correctly. 

I already know about observing opponent habits but the problem is this: characters with options. Like legit I don't know what to do against Falcon because he can dash grab, dash attack, shff Nair, shff dair, feint side b, or empty hop grab. Its ridiculously hard and right now I'm stuck gambling that I can make the right decision.",0

"Yeah I don't remember the last time we had that kind of prospect. I was in elementary school when pierce was drafted and I honestly though rondo would be terrible in the league. He wasn't had his moments his rookie season but wasn't that great. Celtics fans can only hope for a scenario where Danny cashes in on his chips and do a complete turn around (like 2007). Maybe that's why we get excited when our team is in this mediocrity state where we have lots of assets as well as young promising players. I personally think our contending team will only have smart and thomas (as a role player off the bench). Everyone else is a trade chip with those picks.

Reason being is that they own at least one, some of them many guns, and rarely go to the range more than once a year. They also don't carry, or even use them for home defense.  I can't think of any other reason they own them than to look at them and to impress their friends.",0
"He's a forward, he's not expected to set the tempo like a CM or play like Hazard and Neymar. You could apply the exact same critique you wrote to Reus and most would still call him a great playmaker.

Sometimes it's almost like Bale is punished for being so much better an athlete than most that people forget that even speed and strength aside he has freakish natural ability. Not as good in tight spaces as Hazard or at close control dribbling as Neymar 

But combine that with the fact that he's 80% (to pick an arbitrary figure) as good as them at those aspects of play (which is still better than the vast majority of players) and add in his freakish athletic ability and he can be just as if not much more effective, dangerous and useful when in good form. 

As Di Maria has shown this year a more traditional, technical playmaker/forward is much less effective than a more athletic one when out of form. ",0

On the other hand, Max and Jaidynn were absolute *sweethearts* as well!

I think if I included stuff outside the season, I'd throw my vote with Miss Fame. If I restricted myself to things only said on the season itself, it would be either Max (for building people up) or Jaidynn (for being forever friendly).

Katya also... but the only thing that makes me a *lil* bit hesitant with Katya is that she does tend to kiki with bitchiness and does sometimes come across a bit as Ginger Minj's background vocalist when she's being cunty.",0

"*Here's the Urban Dictionary definition of* [***tsundere***](http://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=tsundere) : 

---

&gt;Tsundere is a slang born on the Internet, and it is a word to describe the nature of female anime or game characters. Tsundere is a word combining two words, ""Tsun Tsun"" and ""Dere Dere"". Both terms describe attitudes of a person. ""Tsun Tsun"" is used for cold/blunt/curt attitude, while ""Dere Dere"" is used when a person becomes [spoony](http://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=spoony) in front of his/her lover.

&gt;(Definition is from the game "" Tsuyokisu Cool×Sweet "")


---

_Therefore, ""Tsundere"" is a female character who is usually cold, but she becomes spoony on her lover. Or, she is cold to the main character at first, but she becomes lovestruck later._

"While it depends on the world you are playing, from what I understand in Golarion necromancy pulls souls out of Phrarasma's boneyard before they can be judged. When an undead dies, its soul is destroyed.

The problem is the lesser god Groetus who hangs out above the boneyard. When the last soul is judged, Groetus descends on the boneyard which starts the end times. Pharasma keeps away Groetus by feeding him the souls of atheists. 

So every time you raise the dead you bring the world one step closer to a permanent end. That is why creating undead is evil. 

In general resurrection spells bring the soul back to life and usually is treated as it wasn't the soul's time yet. A resurrected character's soul still goes to the boneyard when it dies.

There are such things as non-undead necromancy. Essentially necromancy spells that don't deal with creating undead deal with the forces of life and death. Stuff like blindness/deafness, bestow curse and disrupt undead are under necromancy. Usually necromancy involves negative energy as well and as long as you aren't using it to heal the undead I don't see a problem with it.

I wouldn't worry too much about it. The viewership will stop declining eventually. I remember about a year ago the yogscast was experiencing the same problem. Viewership was going down and many doomsayers kept on harping about how they're dead and that this will be the end of the yogscast.  But now the yogscast is getting better and better views.  Their viewership is going back up and things are looking pretty good for them.  I think the reason YouTube groups experience this is because people's tastes change over time.  Some people have watched RT since the start but you cant expect that these people will keep watching forever.  People will leave and new people will come.  ,0

I start out in what seems to be the Amazon, like the trees and rivers. But they are Islands similar to the floating ones in Avatar. (I was having these dreams before the films but they are the closest thing visually) .Except the river is very straight, canal like. I'm floating down it as it gets faster and faster. I'm joined but random people I can't recognise, but they are floating down with me. There is no visible floating device. The river is straight but the trees and vines turn around me. Soon this ride takes me off the edge into the longest drop I ever seen. Its an almost perfect circle down, I can see other straight rivers entering from the sides. I fall down, I keep falling for a while. Then fade I to black, when I wake up, I'm wet and I'm down a street. The but there is only 3 houses I see, I'm encapsulated in a box, the blue walls go all around with room to spare. I get out of the gutter and walk to the first house in front of me. I peer through the window. There is a family inside, all happy, like Christmas dinner time. But not, one of the older children turn to look at the window and they see me. She screams, the while family looks over and they start panicking. I get worried and jump back, looking around. There is a mirror just floating between the house. I stand in front of it and look. I can't describe what I see, but it brings me to tears instantly. I cry desperately to this mirror, sobbing into my limbs (sometimes hands, othertimes tentacles, once wood). I sit down on the curb outside these 3 houses still crying where the youngest child comes over to me and puts a hand on my shoulder. At this point, it feels like the camera ending as I can see the child resting the hand on the thing and I pan up into the darkness where I wake up.

-----

&gt; I associate pedantry with bad arguments.

I like how holding you to YOUR OWN WORDS all of a sudden become ""pedantry"". I associate intellectual dishonesty with bad arguments.

&gt; You don't understand what ""associated"" means?

as·so·ci·ate, verb, 1. connect (someone or something) with something else in one's mind. I ASSOCIATE weakly failed passive aggressive attempts to discount an argument by discounting the arguer with an ad hominem fallacy

&gt; I associate a weak vocabulary with bad arguments.

Ah, again. That's yet ANOTHER example of ad hominem. ""This is a bad argument because you can't speak well."" The argument and the vocabulary are not related to each other. OOPS! I like how you denied using a logical fallacy, only to IMMEDIATELY use it again. Well done, you fucking dummy, you just succeeded in putting ""I don't actually know what the fuck I'm talking about"" in bold.

&gt; Why do you hate children so much?

Are you fucking kidding me with that? I ""hate"" children because I say cutting parts of their body off without permission or medical necessity is wrong? Wow. THAT's logical.

&gt; ... easier for boys to keep clean, or avoid infections?

Hey, have you heard of this new thing called soap? It's apparently amazing at keeping things clean. No need to amputate body parts anymore. It's great! Oh, and have you also heard of this other new thing called ""medicine""? Like, if you get sick, you can take something and get better! No need to amputate! Wow! Modern medicine rules! It's way better than bronze age medicine, which is what you're advocating.

&gt; peace of mind that comes with knowing they have the penis that women prefer?

Hmm. The penis version of Pascal's Wager. Way to go. I like how you're advocating cutting up someone's body without permission based on the hypothetical assumption that a hypothetical mate would hypothetically prefer it. Sure sounds like rock solid reasoning and not emotionally charged cultural bias. Oh wait, no it doesn't. That's a retarded fucking argument and you're an idiot for making it.

cosmetic surgeries are performed on infants every day.

&gt; Yeah, TO FIX FUCKING PROBLEMS. Mutations. Abnormalities. Broken bits. The foreskin is NOT any of those things. Unles, of course, you're so thurougly brainwashed by your culture that you can't think clearly for yourself. Then it's a bad thing, because a bronze age man said so.

"I think people eat more and less healthily when they smoke because lots of people time their toking very poorly. For example, people smoke in the evening, after dinner. Now you get the munchies, so you eat again. And because you're stoned, you're not likely to eat something healthy but instead have whatever is convenient(junk food). 


I've alleviated this issue with myself by smoking while I cook dinner. I eat a relatively healthy meal right as the munchies kick in, and I am good for the rest of the night. If you time your smoking with your meals, I expect it will be less of a problem. And planning ahead to have healthy snacks around could also help. Have some fruit or something instead of doritos.

So my argument would still be that winning a ring this year doesn't influence his legacy a huge deal. He's already got a great legacy and in the conversation for ""best big ever"".

No you have been doing that. I don't think you can even begin discussing the notion of rational basis until you have a clear understanding of what marriage is. I don't even think it is the right way to think about the problem to begin with.

The only thing I have said on the matter is that I don't think the legislative difficulties imposed by polygamy are a big deal.

---------------

&gt; Fortunately, the law is judged from the standard of a reasonable person. 

And this is the belief of reasonable people.

And believing that marriage grants any kind of dignity is also a subjective determination.

"Hey hey, as a final year medical student I can confirm that shadowing isn't really something that is done here per se, but there are opportunities down the line to get involved in emergency medicine.

Depending on which medical school you apply to, they will offer a variety of placements, some of which will be in various areas including emergency. That being said, I fell in love with emergency med within the first few years of my degree, but as a medical student we're really good at falling for almost every different type of specialty. I can guarantee that you will change your mind at least 5 times within your first semester at uni. As Mick_kerr's comment, try and enjoy your moment; get involved in the placement you're in. 

If you're also undertaking rural terms, they can provide a really good hands on approach to working in a rural ED, where bulk interesting patients present. 

Medical schools can also offer elective terms in the later years where you might be able to arrange with a particular department in any state to take a term (approx 6-8 weeks) with them. This is normally only later on in the degrees (years 5-6 in undergrad or years 3-4 in postgrad)

"&gt; With every large title release there's no doubt that hundreds of thousands, if not millions, will have already purchased these games.

True. My point was that with so few games available currently - this is even *more* true and more of an issue.

&gt; The indie titles might be new to most because most people don't like indie games.

Or, you know, it could be because they don't have million dollar ad campaigns and aren't featured on blogs and websites on a weekly basis. Or the player simply doesn't care about or follow gaming blogs and news beyond whatever game their friend showed them.

Sure, there are people that don't like 'indie' games... Which I don't understand as a blanket statement since 'indie' is not a genre... but that doesn't mean *most* people don't like them. But yes, it's true that some people just want awesome 3d graphics that are gritty and real and guns and blood and anything but something that might be seen as 'cartoony' or 'for kids'. 

&gt;The gaming population would be better off with higher quality titles that a lot of people already own as opposed to a shitload of crappy indie titles nobody even want to own.

First off, it's your *opinion* that higher production values equate to *higher quality* games. I strongly disagree, as AAA game design is largely redundant and uninspired. Secondly, you're assuming/projecting that these indie games are crappy and that *most people* don't like them.

Overall, I just simply disagree with you. Giving away a game that's been out for over a year - that everyone already knows about - that has already been purchased by the people who are actually interested - is simply not-enticing. Nor does it really help the developer in any meaningful way aside from getting that cut that Sony gives to developers/publishers of the games on the IGC.

Whereas, giving away a handful of indie games that are lesser known gives us an opportunity to discover something we didn't even know about that might actually pleasantly surprise us. When a game does appeal to people, this causes them to start telling their friends about this lesser-known title, garnering more interest... which could, very likely, result in a lot more actual purchases after their IGC month because the word-of-mouth recommendations are slowly spreading out to those never knew about it. This helps these struggling developers (and usually actually go to the developers themselves) far more than the AAA publishers.

"&gt; But the difference? Players in other sports aren't going on reddit and reading posts about themselves (if you want to use basketball players who are 18ish in the NBA). 

Teams like TSM ban their players from reading reddit for a reason. If social media isn't helping you, if your fanbase is nonexistent, don't bother logging into twitter or facebook to view death threats and people calling you trash. 

&gt;They have years and years of professional experience around them, trainers and players and coaches and all of these people that, should someone actually get down from what they're saying, there's an entire support staff around them. Sports psychologists and everything.

MOst LCS teams are already at this level though! LXGG, specifically, is on a team with Seraph, who had terrible nerve issues and issues facing the community. People still have the same tools to deal with these problems. 

&gt;That player isn't in your living room hearing you say it. This player could be on reddit reading it.

Lol people in Philly chant ""EAGLES"" when the Phillies aren't doing good. Live crowd fans can be just as brutal as reddit. 

&gt;You're making my point.

Not really. I'm pointing out that while people shouldn't say it, that it is going to happen and realistically, players need to learn how to deal with it. Without doing that, players are going to constantly cave to trolls and pressure. 

And don't think that the community alone brings about this pressure, management can as well. Don't deceive yourself into LXGG not thinking this wouldn't happen.

"lol CRUSHED got some haters, he will CRUSHED you guys in LAN even if Chiv enforced a single FoV (which I honestly wish it did like in CS and many other FPS, but not sniper zoomed in like 95 fov). CRUSHED made soaphax mad, made a video (""look atchu man, all u do is gamble""), and made it private because he is the CRUSHED

~~So i ask for Help while in a Classic Duel Server, and he is what happens.
He Doesn't Help, He Randoms and Spawn kills, if he gets hit He Fountain Chugs. (This was Within Vals Classic Duel Server) All in All, he randomed roughly 60 or so times, With around 50-55 of those being spawn kills.
He is NOT what the Community is to be. Randoming and Spawn killing in a CLASSIC duel server (Apparently he doesn't understand what that is despite Multiple explanations). Even another player of the Server (Who was friend of CRUSHED) said ""Your the one being the dick. He asked for help, Not Randoming and spawn killing.""
Worse over all this, He acted as though it was my fault for asking for help. As though He had no choice in it and that No matter the 50-55 Randoms he did, it wasn't his fault for Randoming, NO. It was MY fault. All because i asked for help, and then requested him to stop spawn killing and randoming a near Countless amount of times, and then he expected me to have to change MY class and how I want to play, so HE doesn't Random or Spawn kill ME.
Tell me how much sense this makes like it sounds to me
A Player asks you for help, So what do you do?
Spawn Kill him 50+ Times, literally just allowing enough time to spawn and then killing him, and doing this Over Four Dozen Times. AND then, You blame HIM for causing all of this, When he has asked you to stop. Since the Second or Third Random/Spawn Kill. And your at 50+ Spawn Kills at this point. NO, its HIS fault for not changing HIS class because HE asked for you to stop, but didn't change his class, its HIS fault.
Victim Blaming in 101. Its THEIR fault for requesting help, Requesting for you to stop, and its THEIR fault because they didn't have you stop.~~

The original did this great, through limited use of CGI and lots of practical effects. The up close interactions the characters had with the raptors (and other dinosaurs) were so believable.

Here's a cool dumb story. I was doing a Viking combat display for the National Maritime Museum in Sydney. Threw my shield at my opponent, who responded by reaching out and hitting my now exposed, unarmoured hand, and severed my left index finger. I was then taken into a nearby corporate lobby where I bled copiously over expensive Italian leather couches, then on to RPA hospital where I was the first sword related injury in over 100 years. Only part of the incident I remember is looking at where my finger was now hanging by a single tendon, seeing the bone and spurting blood, and saying,

""That'll need stitches"".

My next clear memory is of sitting in the A+E waiting room oh the RPA with a bunch of other fully armed and armoured Vikings. Finger was surgically reattached and I retain about 90% functionality, but have a cool scar and a unique story.",0

"I have seen a lot of these ""chance me"" posts on SDN and I really don't think anyone can offer a definitive answer either way.  That being said, I have been where you are and have benefitted a great deal from the advice and perspectives of others who were there before me.  So based on my experience applying, doing a lot of reading about applying, and speaking with others, a few points come to mind for you.  

Firstly, your experience is great.  A lot of applicants focus on research or clinical experience and you have both.  It sounds like you have this aspect of your application down.  You will have great stories for your app essays and be able to earnestly describe your interest in dentistry to interviewers.

Secondly, your GPA isn't amazing, but it also isn't bad.  It certainly won't disqualify you, given your experience.  I have heard anecdotally that schools prioritize GPA above experience.  Perhaps a great GPA can even outweigh a lack of experience because it shows that you can handle the academic rigor of dental school.  

Which, brings me to my last point: On the other hand, since your GPA is not amazing, you need to show that you have mastered the basic science curriculum that is the foundation of what you will learn in dental school.  Unfortunately, your only option (other than taking more classes and raising your GPA) is to dominate the DAT.  

Your DAT score needs to improve.  

Some schools have a cutoff where they will not accept an applicant with scored in any section under 17.  Your chances are not great right now.  You might get interviews, you may even get in, but the standards for admission to dental school are against you. 

But that's okay!!!  Because you can improve your chances. So don't rule yourself out, just do some serious soul searching, dig deep down and find the will to come back and dominate the DAT.  The fact that you rushed through the last section is indicative to me that you weren't prepared.  Ask yourself what this path and career means to you and if it means enough, then use your willpower to sacrifice and study hard.  

Make a plan.  Remove all distractions and obligations. Take 6 weeks off and study every single day.  Grab some exercise and see a friend or SO now and again, but make it your life's mission to succeed on the DAT.  

I believe that you want to become a dentist.  I believe that you will make the choices you need to get there.  I believe in you. 

Now go get it!!! :)",0

Ouya has had its back against the wall from day one, it was thrown under the bus by the gaming press, and it lacked the capital backing that has allowed other more established companies to enter the marketplace.

"My partner researches MS blood rheology and genomics so credit to her for this info:

Multiple sclerosis (MS) is an autoimmune disease of the central nervous system (CNS), in which lymphocytic infiltration causes destruction of myelin and axons. During the initial stages, inflammation is temporary and the myelin sheath is able to regenerate, resulting in transient episodes of neurological disability. 

While the cause of MS is yet be established, there are proposed theories, which include genetic susceptibility, environmental factors, microbiological infections, and immunological lack of tolerance, leading to the development of the chronic inflammatory features of MS. 

Hypotheses on possible infections are supported by the association of Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) with increased risk of developing MS (Levin et al., 2003). Lang and colleagues (2002) proposed cross-reactivity of T-cell receptors (TCR) to DRB1*1501-restricted myelin basic protein (MBP) and DRB5*0101-restricted EBV peptide as the mechanism behind the increased risk. In addition to possible molecular mimicry, EBV infected B-cells have been found in the meninges and post-mortem brains of MS patients and not in other neurological inflammatory diseases (Serafini et al., 2007). 

The pathological processes of MS encompass inflammation, demyelination, remyelination, oligodendrocyte depletion, astrocytosis, neuron and axon degeneration, which ultimately result in the formation of sclerotic plaque in the CNS (Compston &amp; Coles, 2008).

Migration of autoreactive lymphocytes across the blood brain barrier (BBB) is believed to initiate the disease process, though research attempts to identify whether the BBB is dysfunctional prior to immunocellular infiltration. Altered haemorheology, leading to ischemic injury of the cerebral microvasculature, has been proposed as a mechanism for BBB dysfunction (Ballabh, Braun, &amp; Nedergaard, 2004). The extravasation of the T lymphocytes is achieved through the interaction of tumour necrosis factor α (TNFα) and interferon γ (INF-γ) with endothelial adhesion molecules LFA-1 and VLA-4 (Engelhardt, 2006). Th17 lymphocytes may then secrete IL-17, under macrophage mediated IL-23 control, which together with lymphocytic IL-22 disrupts the BBB, allowing T lymphocyte, B lymphocyte and macrophage infiltration (Compston &amp; Coles, 2008). While the antigenic target not fully established, it is likely the MBP and the myelin-oligodendrocyte glycoprotein (MOG). Moreover, an autoimmune response against the αB crystalline chaperone proteins prevents physiological suppression of cerebral inflammation (Compston &amp; Coles, 2008) and autoantibodies against neurofascin-155 and neurofascin-186, which are important for cell migration and adhesion in the CNS, mediate axonal injury (Mathey et al., 2007).

The accumulation of inflammatory cells and pro-inflammatory mediators exacerbate the immune response through the recruitment of naive microglia. Microglia are then activated by pro-inflammatory cytokines and bind to the myelin-oligodendrocyte complex, previously opsonised with Fc fragments of antibodies and complement molecules. Microglial phagocytosis of the myelin sheath occurs upon surface-bound TNFα signal transduction (Compston &amp; Coles, 2008). Pro-inflammatory cytokines, proteases, and reactive oxygen (ROS) and nitrogen species (RNS) accumulate in the CNS further contributing to myelin and axon damage (Ortiz et al., 2014). While action potentials may depolarise demyelinated axon regions, conduction of these impulses occurs at reduced speeds (Compston &amp; Coles, 2008).

In progressive MS, demyelination coexists with diffuse neurodegeneration associated with the build-up of insoluble tau (Bartosik-Psujek &amp; Archelos, 2004). B lymphocyte infiltrates accumulate in the meninges, leading to intrathecal antibody production (Compston &amp; Coles, 2008).

Ambulance calls in saying they have this type of trauma (we will use a traumatic 3/4 amputation of the left arm in a roll over accident as an example). We get 5-10 minutes notice that the patient is coming. So we call everyone. Lab (who does the blood type &amp; screen), X-ray, trauma surgeon, etc.

Patient shows up and we're all waiting for him. If EMS crews didn't get an IV, we have to establish IV access. Either way, we still need to draw the blood for the lab to test to get a blood type. Do we wait for the results to come back? Hell no. This guy is literally bleeding all over the damn place or did so at the scene of the accident.

At this point, depending how bad the patients injury and blood loss is, we just start infusing the 2 units of universal donor blood that lab brought with them, along with fresh frozen plasma (FFP), and normal saline.

I am a Molecular Biology and Applied Maths double major, so I definitely am part of the STEM crowd, but I don't actually feel the way I was impersonating. The only opinion I have that is slightly STEM-circlejerky is that psychology isn't a science in the same way that physics or biology is. I personally admit that biology isn't as hardcore as physics, so it just kinda rubs me the wrong way when psych majors want to consider themselves hard scientists, yet when you compare the courses of study, psych is simply not as rigorous.

Yeah, that's probably a bigoted view I'm guilty of holding, but I'm proud of the work I put into my degrees and when someone suggests that they are my equal when they haven't put in as much work as I have, I get worked up.

"I only point out that this is america because what works in another country may not necessarily work here, not cause murica. If family leave affects both genders and men have it worse how can you use it as an example of female oppression?
 My point is that rape isn't a gender issue and it isn't oppression either.
 I've never had to see a gynecologist so I can't speak on how easy it is to get an appointment but I can't agine it being any more difficult than scheduling any other Dr appointment.
 Roe vs wade may get challenges but its still the law of the land, healthcare in general is expensive so I don't see how that is oppression either. As far as birth control goes there's plenty of inexpensive options and really no excuse since the primary purpose of vaginal intercourse is reproduction, people who are unwilling or unable to raise a child should practice abstinence rather than expecting the rest of society to pay for their birth control so they can have all the sex they like without consequence. If you're having sex you take on the possibility of a pregnancy it's not an accident I don't understand why people want to relieve themselves of responsibility for their actions.

Maybe I'm not recalling correctly on the domestic violence thing I do recall clearly seeing that women are the purpotratirs more often than men and they also tend to use weapons like knives, so I'd say men get hurt worse than women do.

Well women are generally way more emotional than men are so PMS or not you never know how much of what they're saying is truth and how much is exaggeration and drama.

Mansplain is a word made up to silence opposing views when men try to have a say in gender discussions, within the feminist movement men are constantly marginalized and dismissed, because equality. I'm coming into a female dominated apace to offer a different point of view. See you can class men dismiss women because of their gender but that is bullshit women get just as much respect as men do bases on what they're saying. If a woman is spouting crap that is incorrect or irrational then of course shell be dismissed the same as any man doing the same.

I was talking historically in response to the notion that women couldn't so things men could, it worked both ways and it wasn't just women who were forced into certain roles but that never gets brought up because if it was the case for men and women then you can't use it as proof of women being oppressed in the past. If histrionic has gendered connotations I'm not aware of it.

What I've learned from your post - women are somehow oppressed in the first world yet you can't give a single example of it, what you have given is issues that both men and women deal with being appropriated as affecting women only or  affecting women worse and complaining because society is supporting women with free/cheap birth control and healthcare.",0

"I'll add some quick recommendations so I can send you into the world of snails:

* Mizon All In One Snail Repair Cream - *light moisturizer, not enough as a standalone cream*
* Mizon All in One Black Snail Repair Cream - *slightly more moisturizing than the Mizon All In One Cream, but still not enough*
* COSRX Snail Essence - *Great essence to check out, 96% snail mucin filtrate*
* COSRX Snail Cream - *~~Higher snail mucus percentage than Mizon's cream,~~ non-irritating for sensitive skin, overall better*

-- Overall, I think the COSRX Snail Cream would be a great place to start and would probably help the most with hyperpigmentation out of all the other snail creams out there. As for dull skin, I would try out some sort of exfoliation such as Mizon 8% AHA Serum, COSRX AHA Whitehead Power Liquid or Cure Aqua Gel. Vitamin C serums would probably also help with both hyperpigmentation and dull skin so that's definitely worth a look over.",0
"&gt; It doesn't work like that. If they would label her as enemy or have any negative thoughts about her (like even ""I don't like her make-up""), they would be knocked down.

Well, Cherish is screwed, petty teenager that she is. You've still got Gray Boy as being effectively immune, as well as probably Mannequin and maybe Night Hag - Mannequin doesn't actually need air so I'm not sure exactly what stripping away oxygen in his blood would do, and Night Hag isn't human. Siberian also may or may not be effected - I don't know what she does when Manton is sleeping, and I don't know if he would even be hit. King might be able to pass on the effect to a pawn - his power was able to do it with Gray Boy's loops, so it works on pretty abstract types of ""harm."" Crawler's thoughts would be more ""play with me!"" than any sort of ill will towards her, and Bonesaw's would be along the lines of ""you're so cool! I can't wait to look inside your head!"" but I don't know how abstract you want to get with what her power defines as ""ill will."" Given Gray Boy's effective immunity, it doesn't really matter.

&gt;Siberian can be decomposed, since her power protects only against physical things. And he doesn't need line of sight.

She's immune to non-physical stuff like distorted time and, more importantly, Tatsuya has to identify the design of something before he can decompose it. That would cost him a precious second or two and would let the Hack Jobs teleport in to flip his powers off. Teleportation is instant, so his senses and reaction times shouldn't be able to stop it before it shuts him down.

&gt;Well, it may work, though Berserker gains resistance even if something doesn't kill him. God Hand is like fusion between powers of Crawler and Grey Boy.

The loop resetting should reset whatever resistance he gains, if it's a physical thing, or someone could simply go after Illya.

&gt;No, she is not. Saber is fast enough to essentaily be a teleporter for them. And how she reacts to GB is arguable.

Yeah, she sort of is screwed once Avalon is over, because she has no way to take down all of the 9000. If they wanted to, the Gray Boys could simply surround her in time loops while Avalon is up and that would be that. The loops are impassible to anyone but Gray Boy, so Saber's luck or instincts won't help her to escape them if she's already surrounded.

&gt;Cherish rather wont be able to find him, since he is not human anymore and even if she could, he can just turn into spirit and run away.

The bodies of Servants seem to operate the same way the bodies of normal humans do, for the most part, end even if they don't work exactly the same, she can sense case 53s and other not-quite-humans as well. I don't see why she wouldn't be able to sense him. Turning into spirit and running away is a valid plan, but then she would just search him down again.

&gt; If there is any way, Mitsuru takes it. Also OP haven't specified, that it has to be a head-on fight.

He's not specified as getting any prep, and they start in the same city. Unless the 9000 don't know they're in a fight for some odd reason, the Cherishes can work to hunt him down or Shatterbird can simply destroy the city and take him out that way.

&gt;Alessi's stand doesn't have to him opponent, but his/her shadow to work. And even if Siberian may be able to ignore it, Gray Boy cannot, since he has no protection from abilities, that turn time backwards.

Personally, I would argue that Gray Boy's ability to reset to a specific point in his own timeline would protect him from age reversal just as well as it would from any other power, but even if we assume it doesn't there's no way Alessi is going to take out every member fast enough to stop one of them from retaliating, especially given that he can't take out the Siberians.

&gt; Here is Kojou's wiki. He has some hax abilities like Grey Boy-like regen (that also allows him to turn things/people backwards in time), spatial erasure, obliterating several hundreds of kilometers with lighting and shields, that can resist even reality warping.

Looking at those familiars, just from the wiki I'll agree they could probably win if he pulled them out. The big threat to him would be Gray Boy putting him in a loop before he could summon one, as the looping would keep him from completing his chant. If he starts with the right familiars already out or if he starts out of sight somewhere, he should win.

&gt; Well, they can fly. And rift is created upon being struck with SCC beams.

Some people might claim that they're all for acceptance of sexual orientations but when it comes down to it, they really can't let go of their old traditions. It's something that I, as a foreigner, have noticed in Asians, in that traditions are so deep rooted and ingrained that even with how advanced Singaporean society is to say Chinese or Indian society, people still hold these traditions to heart.

It's obviously alot better and alot safer to come out of your closet here in Singapore but you can still feel the judgement.

However, the team doesn't have many pitching prospects so why not trade Baez for a top pitching prospect?  If anything, Baez has lost value since last year due to his extreme struggles at the MLB level (very high strikeout rate).  Trading him while he is still a prospect keeps his high value at the time and brings back another relevant future piece in return.",0

&gt; No longer does the term &amp;quot;Socialist&amp;quot; carry the same stigma it once did - in part because self-identified socialists are few and far between.

&gt; A number of other socialists appeared on the ballot over the years, in the Socialist Labor or Socialist Workers&amp;#039; parties - and, of course, there have been regular candidates running as Communists.

&gt; So when Bernie Sanders, avowed socialist, announces his presidential bid on Thursday, he will not have a large pool of Socialists from which to draw support.

"But Pitt becoming famous is due to him having great looks. If he was ugly, then he would have been passed over for many of the roles he landed. Being pretty is a large reason actors land roles.   If they are horrible actors they are still going land jobs but not as many. Brad Pitt partially became famous for his role in legends of the fall and all the girls absolutely dawned over him and he landed a lot of roles because of women's reaction to him.

The Sex trade has been around longer the Christians have believed Jesus and the bible. This not going to change males are biologically programmed, with some exceptions, to be physically attracted to women at a very animalistic nature. Society as a whole has tried to change this few 100s of years but you can't get around it. Women wearing low tops, short short, yoga pants etc are playing on this primal male Sex drive.

&gt; No longer does the term &amp;quot;Socialist&amp;quot; carry the same stigma it once did - in part because self-identified socialists are few and far between.

&gt; A number of other socialists appeared on the ballot over the years, in the Socialist Labor or Socialist Workers&amp;#039; parties - and, of course, there have been regular candidates running as Communists.

&gt; So when Bernie Sanders, avowed socialist, announces his presidential bid on Thursday, he will not have a large pool of Socialists from which to draw support.

"Choose a crafting class that can support the Disciples of War or Disciples of Magic classes that you're leveling. If you're leveling a tank or post-level 25 dragoon, an Armorer makes most of your armor. If bard, monk, or ninja, leatherworker for the armor. If a caster, weaver. The ""problem"" with this advice, however, is that your crafter will have to be almost the same level as your combat class to make level appropriate armor. Without the list of useful crafting skills listed by /u/Erik_Highwind it may be hard to HQ the gear

Also consider which classes make your weapons. Carpenter for dragoon, bard and whitemage; blacksmith for tank and ninja weapons, plus some monk and dragoon ones; goldsmith for blackmage weapons (and almost all accessories beyond lvl 29); leatherworker for some monk weapons; alchemist for some whitemage weapons and summoner, scholar books. I may have missed a few, you could browse the recipe book on ffxivcrafting.com to understand what each class makes.

Note that the above advice is not necessary for people who are leveling their first combat class. You get some gear every five levels. But it's nice, especially if you can make high quality gear. Firstly, HQ gear has slightly higher stats. Secondly, it spiritbonds faster. When gear is 100% spiritbonded, you can convert it into materia, which is bought and sold actively on the market board, occasionally for ridiculous prices. I'd hazard a guess that once you begin converting gear from the lvl 30-45 range, you'll start getting the occasional gem that sells well. 

You could also choose to level a class that gets most support from the gatherer class you're leveling. Miners provide most of the materials for armorers, blacksmiths and gold smiths, while botanists supply carpenters, alchemists, culinarians, weavers. A fisher is more fun for world exploration than supplying mats. When I was leveling crafters and had to buy materials from the market board, I hated it when I was forced to buy overpriced things, or stacks of 99. This is where self sufficiency in material gathering is a plus. 

The most significant boost to crafting xp comes from tradecraft courier leves, where you usually pick up the leve in a hub city, then turn in the crafted item in another area. If you HQ the item you get double the xp. I believe you'll need to do about 10 of these to advance five levels, so stock up on material accordingly. ",0

You are actually fine. With your own knee, it's a thousand times easier to have normal gait. The most important things to do is keep your muscles strong, and STRETCH.

If it hurts to walk and you're always trying to avoid a certain area, it won't look normal. It also will look terrible if you keep slipping out the socket.

"Is there a way to use my 1.0 install media to switch to PC before Heavensward?

"OSRS from what I hear is pretty god awful. They have a track record of being a bunch of childish pricks, there was an instance of a charity event being flooded with hate from OSRS in chat. That was a livesteam though, Twitch is kind of a cesspool anyway so that's a low blow on them though, I guess?

The PK community is mostly where OSRS went though, and we've seen how aggressive people can get over PVP. 

Anyway, RS3's community's still pretty shitty too but that's mostly shown out of at least a genuine concern. The most annoying thing I see about the community is their stupidity regarding MTX. Being against MTX is totally fine but some people just are dense as shit and refuse to accept being even slightly wrong, then you've just got people who are way too zealous and refuse to want to work with Jagex and instead go for a very ""NO MTX WHAT SO EVER GET RID OF IT NOWWWWWWW"" sort of approach. 

But even those people, they're not assholes really, even the people who really aren't level headed and really have no idea what they're talking about (which is by no means all of them) are really just looking out for what they believe is best for the game anyway. . . 

So compare that to what I've said about OSRS . . . 

Obviously RS3' got my vote. 

_____

Being a skiller on RS3? Easier or harder . . . Mm. I guess harder, depends? OSRS doesn't have dungeoneering, dungeoneering requires you to either pay people to let you leech or for you to participate in combat so if we consider that? I guess RS3's way harder, especially with 120 dungeoneering.

Overall I tend to think of, content wise anyway, OSRS v. RS3 like this, RS3 intends to add more and more updates, OSRS will add very sparse, polled updates. RS3 is already years ahead of OSRS content by it's very nature. . . RS3's going to not necessarily be harder or easier as much as it will be more expansive.

We've got [runespan](http://runescape.wikia.com/wiki/Runespan) for runecrafting and you can make some good money on [vis wax](http://runescape.wikia.com/wiki/Vis_wax) so I guess maybe it'd be easier to do it on RS3? The main thing I'm really not sure about is prices for OSRS, this is a huge deal for buyable skills and largely will dictate just how hard things are. Tl;dr not really sure but I'd suggest RS3 anyway.

"I tried to withhold my judgment until the end.  I listened to the whole podcast over the Christmas break with SO and we had been told to listen to it by a friend who was hooked while it was still ongoing.  That friend laid out the evidence of a false conviction and was in the innocent camp when they recommended so I had that in the back of my mind - the whole - there is this serial killer that is the one that actually did it story.

By the end, I was scratching my head.  I thought there was some huge exculpatory piece of evidence coming and I never heard it.  From how SK and Rabia described the prosecution and CG, I expected something much, much more than what was presented. Still, I was pretty sure he was actually guilty but the case was weak.  I was particularly interested in the cell data as I worked in RF and cell planning for many years.  After looking at the actual maps and reading the actual testimony, it is clear that the prosecution did not claim what Serial or the innocent camp said that they claims (being consistent with is not saying is it 100% proof the call was from LP).  Once I read the testimony, I concluded that everything AW testified to was correct.

After reading over the actual transcripts, I am firmly in the guilty camp.  I don't think it was a moment of passion, I think it was premeditated murder over Adnan's pride being hurt.  I think he is a complete liar and lacks and remorse for the crime so he deserves to spend the rest of his life in jail.  I actually feel bad for the people in the innocent camp at this point as they are blind to the manipulation.  I can see the 'fresh from listening' crew still thinking innocent (or not enough to convict), but it is hard to fathom how anyone that has read the transcripts or read this sub for month or longer could still think that.",0

"I'm not sure what to do this election. I can't continue to reward the PC's for their corrupt mismanagement of the province. I've never broken ranks before, I've never had to, after Getty's mess, we had Klein, who was willing to do what needed to be done and weather the outrage. 
But we don't have another Klein right now, just people who put ambition over responsibility. 

I don't actually want any other party in power, but the PC's have to remember to represent us, not themselves. They're completely off the rails and need to be scared back on track. In Alberta, and in Ottawa too. 

The WR would just be co-opted and ultimately strengthen the PC's, the Alberta party might as well not exist as it gets no traction in the shadow of the pc/wr's (too bad, because they're actually fairly reasonable), I'd wipe my ass with a ballot before I'd ever vote for the thieving Liberals, so that leaves me with the NDP, which makes me nervous, they have a history of ravaging provinces and are generally ridiculous. 

But we DO need to play chicken with the PC's or they will never change. 

This is a situation of driving home the point that a home needs to be renovated by tossing a moltov in the living room.

Past examples through history of what is called ""hate"", specifically to ethnic or religious minorities, have not relied on active malice. It is determined more by actions and attitudes inevitably based on treating these groups unequally.

Limiting it to active malice would let someone who supported Jim Crow laws out of callous indifference off the hook. The is a certain type of person out there who will treat these groups like that and not even consider them human enough to warrant a strong emotional response.

I also don't think anything is gained from holding back from identifying hate for what it is.

He hated the ending right?  Generally when something has a really bad ending, you give it a score lower than you usually give it (had it ended better).

Even after the show ended poorly, he was considering giving it an 8.

Yes I guess you can be distracted about fancy art and what not. But the last thing that sticks in your mind is the ending. To give something an 8 and then have a completely thought process that manages to bring down your score in half is really odd, *especially* after the poor ending. 

It makes me think that he was likely over analyzing/nitpicking.

"Just scrolled through this quickly but having worked for a big 4 accounting firm in this capacity, it looks like the standard  sort of template that would be sent off to a potential acquisition but obviously tailored after somewhat more to their specific business.

The real trick is knowing what to make of all the info received I.e. how to analyze and what it means. It's not really that hard actually, just can be a lot of material to figure out.

The most important part of the DD process,  and this is just my opinion, will be the phase after these intial questions,  the follow up questions.  Baaically after finding out some things,  knowing what to ask next to probe further is crucial, to determine if and how much risk there really is.

Finally, I should probably say from experience depending on the size of the transaction a lot of sellers will baulk at such a rigorous list of questions as above.  Which you cant really blame them if for example its a $10k deal, the time spent to get that all together wouldn't be worth it.

Anyone interested in some more basic DD on websites ans startups to see some actual examples, you can see at a site of mine www.digisect.com.

"It sort of like they rolled in Conc and AoE into the gem. Before it was 75% base at lvl 20 + 57% inc. physical dmg. If you ignore the 57% (I use a windripper, so phy dmg doesn't matter to me) then you're doing 45.3% MORE dmg (109/75) compared to before. The base area of the skill also appears to be larger than current lvl 1 RoA on live servers. There's also some changes to Inc. AoE (+20% inc at lvl 1) gem, and to Conc Eff gem (40% more dmg, 25% LESS aoe) These things combined, I'd say it's a very nice buff.

Also forgot to add, they changed the quality bonus from 0.5 attack speed to 1% area damage.",0

"RP is also a dialect, albeit a prestige dialect. Also, not even the queen speaks Queen's English.

&gt; Like all accents, RP has changed with time. For example, sound recordings and films from the first half of the 20th century demonstrate that it was usual for speakers of RP to pronounce the /æ/ sound, as in land, with a vowel close to [ɛ], so that land would sound similar to a present-day pronunciation of lend. RP is sometimes known as the Queen's English, but recordings show that even Queen Elizabeth II has changed her pronunciation over the past 50 years, no longer using an [ɛ]-like vowel in words like land.",0

For example, Robert Bates was a reserve sheriff deputy in Oklahoma who shot Eric Harris in the back. Bates wasn't a member of the union, he was a volunteer and a donor to the department.

The issue also isn't cops not getting fired, it's a pervasive attitude within the criminal justice system. Prosecutors do not need the union's permission to investigate criminal complaints against police. The failed indictments in New York and Ferguson last fall had nothing to do with unions. Police abuse of power is criminal, they should be going to jail not getting fired.",0

"Oh man. I worked at a place over the summer that was generally *hell*. In the almost 90 days that I worked there, 18 people were fired or quit, including the one guy that got thrown in jail. some of them didn't work there for longer than a week. the guy that was hired the day before me didn't last beyond lunch break.

This was for a variety of reasons: Scheduling was always a bit fucky; we were almost always behind schedule. A couple of times my friend and I stayed there working until 8 PM (after starting at 6 AM and supposing to get out at 3 PM) just so we didn't fall ABSOLUTELY, COMPLETELY behind (which really just meant our manager would have been breathing down our neck until things got fixed and threats of firing us). Things broke all the time, the shop was always 50% new guys which meant hardly anyone knew what was going on, drama all the time, the company was undergoing acquisition from a larger corporation, the actual work was demanding physical labor...

But the general manager brought donuts in for us nearly every time we had to work on Saturday. We worked a lot of Saturdays. He even brought in a bunch of food and grilled lunch for us one day. He was a great guy, he was just a pretty bad manager. But the donuts made those Saturdays a little less shitty.",0

He played 19 minutes in Game 5, and we got annihilated. It was a closeout game, Miami smelled blood, and they got us. 

There were many reasons why we lost that series, but it was much closer than a lot of people realize. Kendrick Perkins was one of them. James Harden scoring less than 10 points in 3 of those 5 games is another. Hell, he had nearly half as many TO's as points in those 3 games......

"Everytime he plays Bjergsen? In Bjergsen's first NA LCS finals, he destroyed Bjergsen. Hai died like three times total in that final. The second finals, Bjersen did better overall but Hai did great with his Zed too. In regular series, he has always done just fine against Bjergsen except in this split where Bjergsen was clearly better because well he is a better player but he also got way more resources in mid than Hai did.

Dade season 4? Hai never died 1v1 but yes Dade won that matchup but thats like saying Bjergsen got destroyed by POE so he sucks. It happens. As for Xpeke in S3, again Hai did just fine in lane but Xpeke took over late game with his Kassadin. As Hai admitted, C9 made a huge mistake because they thought they could counter Kassadin despite it being a super strong champion that everyone was banning. That said, in that series, Hai was actually the one that mechanically outplayed Xpeke and got a 1v1 kill with his Fizz.

Hai is not weak mechanically, its how C9 plays. They just dont pressure mid and prefers to focus elsewhere because Hai used to be self sufficient. He would compensate for it by putting pressure all around the map at the expense of his lane. But now with most teams getting pretty good at vision game Hai cannot roam as effectively anymore, and with his team not adapting to pressure more in mid lane relative to how much pressure his opponents are getting, Hai has essentially been a sitting duck this split.

Anyways, just because some reddit guys like you says Hai sucks doesnt make it so. I would trust what pros like Shiphtur, Voyboy, and even Bjergsen says about Hai.",0

"Yea, I used to be at UCSD and they had free healthcare for students, but I didn't realize I had ADHD at the time.  I flunked out so any treatment they could have provided can no longer do me any good.  It's okay though, I'm working my way to transfer to another university.  

When I first got kicked out I was bitter at UCSD, feeling like they could have been more understanding and all that, but I've since gotten over those feelings. I realize that as administrators they just thought that I wasn't taking school seriously; it's not like they were out to get me for no reason.  

Plus, I think it doesn't matter what university or college a person attends as long as they make the most of their experience there.  Being a 4.0 student at a lesser known university is better than being a 2.0 student at UCSD or some other prestigious university like Harvard; at least in my opinion.  Others might disagree and think that only the name of the school matters.

The chances of your family disowning you for being a vegan is incredibly less likely than if you were gay. Being gay also isn't a choice. Being vegan is. Which means that I don't believe it's fair to give the comparison to coming out of the closet.



If you feel bad about the meat industry, then go vegan. Like I said, you *will* face criticism, humiliation, taunting, and so forth. But every social cause has had that issue. Women could've sat down and shut up whilst men ran the world, but feminism would never have gotten its reach. Women would've been stuck in the household unlikely to ever get a job beyond possibly that of a secretary position.



~~Black Americans could've kept their lips shut and sat at the back of the bus, but they would've continued to be put down if they didn't speak up.~~



If you believe in something, truly believe in it, you need to stand up and fight for it. You don't need to tell everyone you're vegan at every possible interaction (I only bring it up when it's relevant), but to say you hate the system but not to fight against it is both hypocritical and cowardly.



And yeah, they're curious because it seems unusual. You're so used to eating meat. Why stop eating it and why now of all times? You've got to talk to them about it first to see if they'll be supportive or not. If they're not, then you can always go vegan or vegetarian when you have control over your own life.

"I think the idea you have is a good one. I told my mom when I went into labor last time. She spontaneously called in for work that day (It was 5 am at the time) and sat in the parking lot of the birth center all day until 2pm when the boy was born. And of course she told me this, so it was in the back of my mind the entire time. (She wanted to come in and wait in the waiting room. No? I had no idea what was going to happen. Those sound proof doors are good but...things like the shower and stuff are on the other side. All I need would be for her to see me, run down the hall and engage.)

In addition, we had a video chat with my mother in law with this baby at the gender reveal baby shower, and she posted some stupid picture she found, on facebook for all her friends to see, before I even got home from the shower (not a picture of our cake or anything, since there weren't any pictures yet...). I looked at the time stamp, did the math and figured out she had done it immediately. I confronted her about it, she deleted it, and still didn't re-share the picture that I had posted. Damage was done anyway.

Yeah, neither of them are knowing we're in labor until the baby is born, and they are not getting pictures until I post them myself. Remember, if they do it once, they'll probably do it again.",0

"&gt; Tennessee accepts New York marriages as legitimate and the new york married couple has all the rights and privileges of a Tennessee marriage when in the state of Tennessee.

Yes, this is correct. That is the point that Roberts was attempting to make. So long as the New York marriage was legal at the time it was formalized in New York, Tennessee accepts it as legal when the couple moves to the state and affords the couple all the rights of marriage in Tennessee.

But Roberts asked why a gay couple (who were married New York) are treated differently from a straight couple (who were married New York) upon moving to Tennessee. Think of this hypothetical:

You are a Tennessee employer who is reviewing marriage licenses for the purpose of spousal health insurance. There is a new employee, Adam, who is married to Taylor. They recently moved from New York.

The marriage license is legitimate, so why should you treat it differently if Adam is married to Taylor Swift versus Taylor Lautner? By denying health insurance to Taylor Lautner, you are effectively retroactively applying Tennessee marriage laws to a New York couple. That is improper under the Full Faith and Credit Clause.

&gt; This is why marriage sinks to the least common denominator. 

Marriage has always flowed to the lowest common denominator. That is why Las Vegas became a mecca for quickie, drunk marriages. There is no requirements about waiting periods or blood tests or counseling.

It is also why Scalia and Roberts hinted that they could rule against Question 1 but rule in favor of Question. It would create an exception that swallows the rule.

&gt; If California were to institute a single party initiated no-fault divorce without residence requirements that ignored pre-nups, then every marriage across the country would now be subject to that ""free divorce."" 

This forum shopping already occurs in divorce cases though. That is why there is a whole cottage industry dedicated to choice-of-law questions with respect the divorce. One real world example is Katie Holmes divorcing Tom Cruise:

&gt; When Katie Holmes filed for divorce from Tom Cruise, she made a strategic move by choosing to file in New York rather than California.

&gt; New York is a good state to file in for parents who are looking for sole legal custody of their child—as Holmes is, according to TMZ. California is more likely to offer shared custody. (However, filing for divorce could be bad for Cruise since he has been trying to avoid the high tax rates in the city.)

http://laist.com/2012/06/30/katie_holmes_tom_cruise.php

&gt; So this notion that there is any kind of guarantee that ones marital rights will be protected outside of the state is a legal fiction. 

But it is a legal fiction that has been consistently applied to all straight couples getting married. Suddenly when gay couples could get married too, states dedicated to stop the uniform applicable of the legal fiction. Such an abrupt change in state behavior signals a discriminatory purpose to the courts. (It was the basis for ""Windsor"" where the federal government had accepted any and all state marriages, but suddenly changed this practice when same sex marriage started.)",0

"Posting for the sake of misinformation which is rampant here.
""How long are you supposed to wait until you should get tested I believe it's two weeks, but I'm nervous wondering if that's too early?""
First off let's address this, there a lot of different types of HIV tests. The first which detects HIV the earliest post exposure is an HIV RNA test. This test has a high false readings rates which is why its seldomly ever used. The second earliest is a 4th generation HIV test which are very accurate now and have around a 90% success rate at 2 weeks post exposure(I recommend this test to ease your mind due to its early test time and high success rate.) The most common are 3rd generation HIV tests which are nearly 100% accurate at 6 weeks post exposure. None of these numbers are at 100% for 2 reasons, one to address possible failures in the test itself and two to address people who seroconvert later than others. Everyone who isn't heavily immuno-compromised will be detectable at 8 weeks on a third generation test, but I still follow CDC recommendations of follow up testing at 3 months to further confirm earlier tests. Note that this follow up test does not mean you will be HIV positive at 3 months you most surely will not as this is just a safety measure to get rid of those pesky .0000001% chances of test failures(which are mainly just statistical backlash anyways.)
TL;DR on testing etiquette: RNA test don't do it, 2nd generation do it at 2week post exposure, 3rd generation test at 6 weeks and always test again at 3 months.
http://www.rnceus.com/fl2hiv/test2.html
source for information above and keep in mind the gaps in stats are to incorporate people who have compromised immune systems such as people on chemo, late stages of cancer, and heavy drug users. The windows of testing are large to make sure that no one slips by due to any matter as it would be negligent to otherwise considering the severity of HIV.

Next on the list the risk:
The average per risk of condomless sex from topping a male who is infected with HIV is .03%. Yes it really is that low, HIV's ability to infect is very low as it infects a very specific and hard to find cell that it has to just bump into aswell as considering that HIV is extremely fragile. The virus dies near instantly upon exposure to oxygen and the viral amount needed to infect is roughly 2 million units of HIV(to put this into perspective the highest HIV amount the largest mosquito can carry from feeding off an AIDS infected patient is roughly 1,000 units which is near a full ounce of HIV infected blood from the highest concentration naturally possible. You can begin to see why HIV has a low infection rate and this isn't even taking into consideration the effect that the mucous membrane plays in your urethra in preventing HIV from passing into your body.
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HIV/AIDS
I feel like I have rambled enough.
You chances of contracting HIV are very low just test at the above recommendations and test again at 3 months for guidelines sake and in the future take care of yourself, know the risks, be careful, and remember that sex is only a small part of your life that could ruin the rest of it.",0

I've also seen some variety of loadmaster position, but I'm not sure what that looks like in combat.

Regarding the all-or-nothing Firespray situation, who says everything is handled by the pilot? Why can't more than one person help? Remember that this is a narrative game that easily handles semi-flexible time flow, so you don't need to rigorously adhere to deckplans or other matters that are not outright stated. Even if you insist on one crewmember controlling everything, who's to say that the rest of the party can't be backseat drivers? They can make their rolls to come up with suggestions to manage the comms, angle shields, and use other systems, leaving to pilot to only have to input their requests and then focus on their own actions. The pilot should be literally limited to one maneuver and one action, but rather can only himself complete that many tasks; there's nothing saying he can't be doing other things in a round like inputing the actions of the rest of the party.

"Could you please show me where in the TORAH this is taught? Teshuva is outlined multiple times, and it involves atonement for sin. For example, see Leviticus 5:5-6, Leviticus 5:15-16, Leviticus 6:4-6.

Teshuva is turning back to YHWH, making restitution to remove the guilt, and then offering sacrifice to atone for the sin.

Lev 17:11: ""For the life of the flesh is in the blood: and I have given it to you upon the altar to make an atonement for your souls: for it is the blood that maketh an atonement for the soul.""

&gt; It is THE BLOOD that maketh an atonement.

You can make restitution with your fellow man, and repay what you owe, or have transgressed in, but this does not bring atonement. Recompensation covers the GUILT of your offense against your FELLOW MAN. Atonement covers the CONDEMNATION unto death that YHWH has judged you with. You must be forgiven on both accounts. Recompensation is not teshuva. You must also be forgiven by YHWH himself.

Could you show me where in the Torah atonement is made without a life being given for your own? Sin brings death. When you sin, you are worthy of death, and blood must be shed, this is a Torah principle, and it is immutable. How do you gain atonement without temple sacrifice? If you cannot prove your position from the TORAH, then it is invalid. Isaiah 8:20 says:

""To the torah and to the testimony: if they speak not according to this word it is because there is NO LIGHT IN THEM.""",0

""TRP has resonated with a lot of guys. I don't advocate it as a cult, and I pick and choose what I find is true, false, or unproven (in my eyes).""

As I said before, I don't tend to read reasonable things like this here very often(maybe it's me).

""I advise you to look past the language of absolutes and see if there is any truth or useful information for your life. I found a lot of interesting stuff in the sidebar. ""

There are some truths and valuable nuggets of information in just about every group, but some groups are so shifty/seemingly unethical at large that you tend to stay away. For every guy like you seem to be, in this /r there are a whole bunch of guys who just flat out give the impression they have very little regard for women, and certainly don't see them as people to be treated with respect, ad the justification is that she secretly likes all that shit, cuz instincts and evo psyche.

I mean, read this from a recent thread: ""Women cock block out of instinct because they're jealous, petty creatures for the most part."" That, in essence is why people hate RP so much. Most people(including myself) would still have major issues with what RP teaches, but wouldn't hate it quite so much if so many of it's members weren't so damn mean-spirited and opportunistic.

""I think part of it is that a lot of men refuse to believe the stove is hot and have to be burned a few times for the idea to stick. Maybe you've just had good relationships that have never ended badly for you.""

Oh buddy let me tell ya, I have. And you and I both know how utterly horrible it can be, especially if you were in love at the time. I get how bad things can get, but I still recognize that it's an issue with either myself, or the specific women I was involved with. No matter how tempting it might be when I feel bitter to make general declarations about the supposed nature of women, I couldn't do that and still be logical.

Besides, this last paragraph could as easily be used by women(and has), to make general claims about men and how they're this way and that, because the particular woman just had issues with particular men. 

I don't see how either case makes sense.

Picrd is a key character, fitting into the archetypal role of the wise old man.  (If you don't know about archetypes, its interesting.  I suggest at least a glance at Jungian archetypes)

In your dream, you start in a cave, in the dark, captured by ogres who represent violence, barbarism.  You had given in to fate.  But it seemed like Picard, representing leadership and strength, gave you hope.  He was human, like you.  Your hope turned to disgust when he proposed intimacy.

"The Witcher series is a very very lore based game.   The Witcher 3 is going to have plenty of cutscenes and a ton of dialogue/choices to make.    So the Witcher 2 didnt even come close to 80 or even 10% of just cutscenes.   I suppose if you rushed through it and did nothing but main story quests you would tend to spend more time in them or if you consider dialog cutscenes?   If anything I would bet Witcher 3 is going to have way more cutscenes than previous titles.  However in a 50hr straight playthrough its probably still only a few hours at most total.

Long answer: Its multifactorial, but includes the most important difference, course management.

Almost no lies are truly flat on the course, and of course don't forget about rough and hazards. Certainly not least, is short game/approach.

Well, because it hasn't been done exactly right. 

Selling Skyrim mods (per installation) is a thoroughly bad idea. A lot of mods depend on other mods. So, either mods that are used in other mods would have to be free and copylefted (so their creators get nothing) or there should be a whole system in the workshop that tracks mod dependencies and makes you buy/install all required mods. But all of that would require extensive curation which Valve did not want to do.

Without a system to track all of this, payment model that Valve chose is simply incompatible with how mods are actually made currently, and it would be impossible to make that system make sense. ",0

"Well, that's why most IT certs now you just pay the yearly maint fee and keep up on continuing ed. That's how most professional licenses work.

That being said, if that's the route we're going to imitate, I'd prefer to just do it for real then. Make an actual non-profit IT licensing body in each state, or nationally, and have them come up with standardized licenses. A better solution for employers so they know exactly what they're getting in a candidate, and a better solution for candidates so they're not paying a bunch of money to 2-3 certification companies every year.

I'll say that I was more aggressive than I'm used to when it comes to 'debate'. I felt like pressing my point forward, instead of just trying to contradict OP. It's a nice perspective to have, I think; to be paying Riot for what they've given you in experience and a quality time in League of Legends. It's one worth sharing, no?

So in the case that you wanted to kick me in the head because I sounded like (pardon the French) a twat, I don't necessarily blame you. I probably could've sounded a lot more disciplined. With that said, I don't necessarily want to. This is /r/leagueoflegends, after all; I'm not an alien and I don't want to present myself like one.

"My blood pressure is definitely higher than baseline... my pulse is always at least slightly elevated.  No doubt.  I've been taking siladenifil but am planning on getting tadalafil as it's got a longer half-life.

As far as whether it's worth it... I'd say it all depends on how cheap you can get it, and what your significant other/children situation is.  IIRC the TD trestolone base I used was priced at ~$80 for 3g TD solution, so $26/1g.  It'd be real nice to get some bulk powder, and make your own TD solution, if you can get it cheap enough... I talked a source down to $36 a gram shipped and that's nowhere near where it needs to be, to be cost-effective.  Compare that to the popular source of pre-prepared trestolone acetate in GSO, which I believe sells at $36/1g on sale, $50/1g not on sale.  GSO compared to TD comes out to be about even if you figure the TD solution is absorbing at 50% at best, which is the unsupported-in-data impression I have.

And I was always worried about not getting it on my girlfriend, and washing up before bed.  That was the worst part about the TD stuff for me, by far.",0

This is going to be tricky. Blueberries, like most fruits, ferment out pretty dry. When you dump a ton of them into a beer, the result is usually pretty tart since all of the sugar turns to alcohol and you're left with a lot of acidity and tannins. To get anything close to as sweet as Wild Blue you'd really have to backsweeten the beer, which is easy if you can force carbonate but trickier if you have to bottle condition, since you'll probably need to use an unfermentable sweetener.",0

Now as for the open shower, this is very similar to the baby sitter scenario. The only difference is it's the parents who take their kids to the showers to see the naked adults and there's no crime involved.

This is totally different when kids see other kids their age naked. Adults are authoritative figures to kids that's why I think they're more vulnerable.",0

"So, in Golarion there's this path of souls... or a river of souls... some large contiguous body of all of the dead souls from forever. And they lead to Pharasma's place in the multiverse. (The Boneyard? Something like that.) And she's... processing them? Look, this stuff is complicated, just bear with me.

So Pharasma has a line of souls going for a long damned time. Lots of dead people, apparently. And on the other end of the line is a thing. I dunno what it's called, but it's bad. It's a bad thing. Really, it's The Bad Thing. When The Bad Thing gets to the front of the line and into The Boneyard the universe ends. Or maybe all life as we know it is extinguished, or the Abyss crashed into the Astral Plane. I forget exactly, but it's bad for everyone. Like, multi-versally bad.

Okay, so Pharasma-souls-souls-souls-souls-The Bad Thing. So what? Well, raising the dead pulls a soul out of line. The more dead you raise, the more souls (or soul energy, or what have you) you pull out of line. Since the souls are pretty literally staving off the heat death of the Universe pulling them out of line is bad.

Creating undead makes everyone (in the truly universal sense of the word) that much closer to planar catastrophy, up to and possibly including having every molecule in your body exploding outwards simultaneously at the speed of light and the frogurt being cursed. That's bad. Like... hastening the end times is actually, objectively, evil. Capital Evil even. The gods themselves have so spoken.

In not-Golarion? The disrespect and desecration thing. Possibly because a god says so.

&gt;I'd like to focus more on the necromancy side of things...

I meet this semi-scene chick, we sneak out and hike to this giant ass purple waterfull that is super fucking wide and looks amazing. we take the bridge over the waterfall, but then the wind throws her off.

And I wake up. the first time it was really vivid and it felt like a movie, while the second time it was like pressing the skip button on the dvr, getting glimpses. then again the second time i wasnt stoned so yea.

"Ok, so your Body Mass Index (BMI) is 31.6. Normal weight is 18-25, overweight is 25 to 30, and obese is over 30. 

I am going to assume for these calculations you are 25 years old. If you are lightly active around the house all day, then you burn about 2200 calories per day. If you limit those calories to 1700 per day (a 500 calorie deficit), then you will lose 1 lb per week. If you want to lose 2 lbs per week, you will need to cut back further to 1200 calories per day.

Of those 1700 calories, you will want to make sure that you get an adequate amount of protein and fat since they will make you feel more full than sugary carbohydrates.

Right now, you are eating a lot of rice and bread which is mostly carbohydrates, and the fruit you are eating (the dates and banana) are sugary compared to, for example, an apple or berries. You might want to steer away from this, but I understand if your food budget would not allow it. ",0

"Well there is also a real systemic, Intel and Nvidia love even in the Linux community for instance which im very close to. Linux people won't buy AMD at all really even though there are some potential advantages coming when comparing the Nvidia on Linux. To go into more detail, the AMD driver on Linux is going through a massive transformation from the ground up, they wrote a new kernel driver, they are even giving more open source code to the community, all of this is great and is stuff the Linux community loves. 

We are talking about 20 million systems just for Ubuntu, Id say 50 million would be a good round number of systems that use Linux in general so there is a market there. This is a market that AMD barely gets any business at all right now. If they have some sort of good will for the work they are doing and market it a bit they could get a good chunk of Nvidia's market share there. Actually if they wanted market share overnight and there wasn't any legal reason not to, if they completely open sourced their entire GPU stack they would be instantly seen as a Linux friendly company and overnight would be the number 1 choice. This is just for Linux and although a small group in the grand worldwide scheme of things its still a dedicated passionate group of people who do repay loyalty with sales. 

&gt; (Complaining about no longer present heat issues)

It is a legitimate concern and AMD should debunk that with better marketing. 

&gt; Even just giving out some swag every once and a while, being personable, etc. would probably go a long way

A proven solid tactic but it works only as long as you target it correctly. If you have a relationship with a youtuber for instance Pewdiepie or Totalbiscuit him just mentioning the type of GPU he is using can drive sales up a bit. So giving out cards to people can be hugely powerful. Out to the public id say it could give some impact but it depends on how its done. For lets say a pcmasterrace one it would have to be a competition and it would have to be something a little bit weird, like the master race man logo thing but do a comic strip or something and the best 5 get the newest most expensive card and t-shirts. That would get a lot of interest and good will. 

&gt; I also have to agree on your point about the Steve Jobs style.

It also depends on how you do it too. A lot of gaming press releases tend to be boring affairs. You would need something spectacular, something that would literally make people go ""wow AMD how the fuck did you do this?"". So you can do that with product innovation sure but id say if it were me, id announce a previously unannounced game that would be available that day at their press even. So a AAA game, something that would cause waves, or more than 1 even. But the crowd and everyone must not have a clue beforehand. You could even announce Linux support too and it would cause that crowd too to make some waves. Its all about getting mass shock and awe. 

If I were the guy, selling AMD products I would want the gaming public to think I was a magician, id want them to be talking about the conferences for weeks afterwards on all of those podcast style shows about gaming. And when I have an event I would make sure people wouldn't miss it even if someone offered you sex with jennifer lawrence.

"Well, my best advice in the meantime is start programming in your free time. You have a computer, and there is a ton of free info out there (Stanford, MIT, and more all have free courses). So try it out. If you have an iPhone or an android phone, try writing an app you think would be useful. Teach yourself.

Hunting down information and methods for doing things is something you'll have to do regularly in programming, so doing it yourself before you're in school is a great way to build those skills.

The reason this is important is if you plan to get a job programming, a lot of places will expect examples of work you've done. From simple stuff like utilities you write to big projects. If you want to work for yourself instead, you need to be the one driving yourself to be at the keyboard programming.",0

"Just a minor nitpick. I think you mean **Mental** Break, not **Magic** Break. Mental Break reduces a target's Magic Def/Resistance, whereas Magic Break reduces their Magic Attack.

I'm no expert in the JP meta, having only started JP last week, but I seem to recall that while Power and Magic Break are two of the most useful Break skills in the game, however Mental and Armor Break generally are not. If you use Vanille, you are freeing up an ability slot on Tidus in your example, to equip another more useful skill such as Dark Buster/Power Break, given that skill slots seem to be something of a premium in the game.

In that sense, Vanille's SB can help a mage-heavy team deal more damage, since it is multi-target. What makes it less appealing is I don't know if Deshell/Deprotega has a 100% status affliction rate, and how long the debuff would last for. For example, if you only run 1 mage, and afflict 3 enemies with it (think FFVI Imperial Camp elite), how long would it take for you to effectively get the most out of that SB? She'd also be great if you run a team utilizing Summoners, or a multi-target Black Magic.

Also, how potent is Garnet's all-Attack buff? I can somewhat agree with her being top, since dropping the ability to use Holy, to buff up to 4 other physical attackers is a good trade-off for DPS.",0

Additionally, the main point of a structural ridgeline is to create the same hammock sag every time you set up.  With your proposed system, the two hammock prussik knots would have to be totally repositioned each hang, unless the tree separation distance happened to be *exactly* the same as the last time you set up.  So what's the point of even having a structural ridgeline if you have to adjust the length every time you hang anyway?",0

"Hm. What if instead of giving forcefield HP, make it a ""number of hits"" thing, like Phoenix's egg in Dota (or even the Changeling in SC2, sorta. in the sense that one hit will kill it regardless of damage).

To kill the forcefields, you have to hit it with n attacks, but the damage those attacks dealt wouldn't factor in at all. 

That would also introduce counter-forcefield *strategy* on top of the existing *tactics*, since you could make units that fire more quickly to counter the forcefields.

""Hm, he's going Stalker-Sentry, so I should really get lots of Marauders, but Marines do way better against force fields due to their attack speed...""

Of course, that last bit^ won't hold true in LotV as much, since Marauders will have a double-attack, but.. just an idea. Not sure if it's a good one.

Personally I'm in favor of reworking forcefields so that they're... not forcefields, but rather, regions in which your units would take say, DOUBLE damage (it would need to be significant). They might need to nerf mana cost/cooldown too if they made it like this. I think that would keep them as a viable means to control and zone your opponent, but get rid of the whole ""I have 5 sentries so you are never getting up this ramp, ever.""",0

"Well, first off, how the sport works:

Two guys compete for up to 12 rounds of 3 minutes each.  They're only allowed to punch (no kicks, knees, elbows, or wrestling holds) and can only hit above the belt.  They're given points by several judges based on how well they performed in each round - mostly landing punches or defending well.

You either win by the judges' points after 12 rounds, or by knocking the other guy down so that he can't get up in a 10-count, or by the referee or the other guy's team deciding that the guy can't safely fight anymore.

So now, as for this fight's importance.  Mayweather is considered by most to be the best boxer in the world - several titles, currently undefeated in his professional career.  Pacquio (who is Filipino) is also considered one of the best in the world - several titles over a long career.  But these two fighters have never gone against each other - ever since 2009, people have been hoping they'd fight, but they never managed to agree on payment, drug testing, etc until now.

So now you've got an undefeated champion going up against a guy who's been considered either the second-best boxer on earth or considered ""maybe even better than Mayweather, but he hasn't gotten to prove it yet.""

So if you're in a Filipino house, stick with the people and cheer for Manny Pacquiao.  He's the underdog in the odds, but not by too big a margin.  I'm hoping for a good fight.",0

I think theres people who argue for riding a purely aerobic levels and not eating much in the way of carbs to 'make the body want to use fat for energy more' ...I've experimented quite a bit with that: at a pace in which I've never gone into amino metabolism for 3+ hours is... slow.

"First, you are selfish.  You want oral sex but don't want to give it.  Simple as that.  If this confuses you, how about ""You want to be cooked for, but don't want to cook.""

The fix is really simple and there's basically only 2 outcomes:

1) You perform oral sex on your awesome girlfriend of nearly 2 years.  She orgasms.  You continue to do this for the rest of the relationship.  In return, you also receive fellatio.  

2) You refuse to give your awesome girlfriend of 2 years the oral sex that she wants and she refuses to give you the oral sex you want in return.  Nobody's happy.  Eventually either you decide that choice #1 seems to make sense or you mutually break up.

As for this:

&gt; If this was a deal breaker for her why is this only being brought up now?

It was, you missed it.  She said that's primarily how she orgasms and you ignored it.  She said she was trying to be subtle and you missed it.  (She is, now, trying to be not-subtle.  It's an improvement in sexual communication.)  Lastly, you said this ""Maybe I would come around to it in the future.""  While she reacted as though you just said ""Nope, never."" it's possible she paid more attention to the phrasing than her response suggests.  Meaning, she may have been hoping you would come around to it.

In general though, you're probably going to want to learn how to do this and either not hate it or actually enjoy it.",0

In a broader but more serious context, the Bechdel test is simply used to illustrate the pervasiveness of imbalances in media representation that relegate women to secondary roles.

That doesn't claim to evaluate the worth of a film (as if the Bechdel test *should* separate classics and pornos into distinct categories), nor does it claim to propose an alternative to a free-market model where people consume what they want and produce what sells.

---

&gt;__Human immunodeficiency virus infection__ and __acquired immune deficiency syndrome__ (__HIV/AIDS__) is a spectrum of conditions caused by infection with the [human immunodeficiency virus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HIV) (HIV).    Following initial infection, a person may experience a brief period of [influenza-like illness](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Influenza-like_illness). This is typically followed by a prolonged period without symptoms. As the infection progresses, it interferes more and more with the immune system, making the person much more susceptible to common infections like [tuberculosis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tuberculosis), as well as [opportunistic infections](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Opportunistic_infection) and [tumors](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tumors) that do not usually affect people who have working immune systems. The late symptoms of the infection are referred to as __AIDS__. This stage is often complicated by an infection of the lung known as [pneumocystis pneumonia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pneumocystis_pneumonia), [severe weight loss](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cachexia), a type of cancer known as [Kaposi's sarcoma](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kaposi%27s_sarcoma), or other [AIDS-defining conditions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AIDS-defining_clinical_condition).

"As silly as awards feel, and as much as the humble Airmen often don't care about (and may even resist) formal recognition, it is important to understand how important awards can be in a long-term career.  As we move into the new EPR system where only 15% can be 4s or 5s, it will be those awards that set you apart (or don't) from other Airmen.  If you ever want to do special duties, those awards will set you apart.  If you ever want to make SMSgt, those awards will set you apart.

And awards build awards.  You get coined, then you win a monthly, then you win a quarterly, then you win a yearly, and then these other awards come up and your supervisor already knows you're competitive AND has the package over half done from writing your previous awards.  Roll with it and good things can come of it.  Remember this when you're a supervisor too.  Your Airmen that don't know will need someone to look out for them, and of course, it isn't uncommon to use subordinate awards as one-of-many metrics to measure NCOs and SNCOs.  A SNCO who can show a pile of awards their subordinates have received is clearly doing something right  for their people.",0

"You are absolutely correct, we have no way of knowing; that relationship could have ended for any number of reasons, his fault, her fault, or nobodies.  But many relationships do end after the birth of a child and the new parents being unable to adjust to the new dynamic, particularly with new fathers having issues of not feeling respected, valued or important.  Considering the lack of understanding shown in the original post at age 30, I'm doubtful OP was more understanding in his lower 20s, and I'm sure there are plenty of mistakes to learn from.

This seems pretty classic stressed out new mom and frustrated father not communicating and taking out their frustration by sniping at each other.  Yeah, mom shouldn't be taking every opportunity to belittle dad, but dad telling new (probably exhausted) mom to back off because she isn't doing anything around the house is the opposite of helping.

&gt; Me: (goes back to bed after taking son to school)
&gt; Her: Are you going to wake up now? You got shitty with me about going to bed last night, are you going to sleep all day?
&gt; Me: I'm awake, my stomach hurts, I didn't think my sleep schedule was a democratic process.
&gt; Her: Well there are still dishes from last night that need to be done!
&gt; Me: You need to lay off, you haven't done anything but laundry for months, I made dinner last night, and took the trash out this morning, etc etc, I don't give you shit about it
&gt; Her: Well I want to vacuum today so you need to get up. (storms off)

The above exchange shows two people who seem to have no respect for what the other is doing and one of them is going to have to make the first move for a while in appreciating the other and not making the situation worse.  Since OP is the one here asking for help, and has gone through a new child before, he is probably best choice for making that first move.",0

"I was born in North Van. 

My parents went to Carson Graham together in highschool. My Dad was born in Chilliwack but moved around a bit as his Dad was in the army. They ended up in North Van, and when his parents split his mom rented places all over the North Shore. His family history is pretty predominantly Canadian going back a few generations to settlers in Ontario and Quebec.

My Mom was born in Winnipeg, shortly after her parents immigrated here from the UK. They moved around a ton while my Grandad looked for work (Quebec, Manitoba, Saskatchewan, Alberta, BC). They eventually bought a house of Capilano Road in 1973, and moved out that same house 2012. They still live in North Van.

My folks left North Van in 1989, they could afford to buy a house in North Van or my Dad could finish his Master's Degree but not both. They did however stay within a couple hours of Vancouver to stay close to family.

I lived in North Van for exactly 2 years of my life (1987-1989), I grew up just outside of Vancouver, spent university on Vancouver Island, and moved back to Burnaby for 1 year in 2010. When I was offered 2 jobs (1 in downtown Vancouver, and one on Vancouver Island) I jumped ship because they paid the same but my quality of living would be shit in Vancouver, and I'd never be able to afford a house. Do I regret it? A little, I'd love to live there, but this way I'll be able to buy a house one day.",0

Hello Scotchit! Here to review the Ledaig 10 today. Bottled 46.3% ABV, I took notes with both a Glencairn and my larger bodied Canadian Glencairn.

**Nose**: salty caramel, fresh tilled earth, lemons

The Canadian gave more presence to the eathy notes of this one and subdued the others somewhat

**Palate**: salt, some caramel, more salt

What happened? I was looking forward to earthy lemony caramel... 

**Finish**: Lemon followed by salt, after letting it open (30+minutes) a touch of the earthiness I was hoping for earlier

This is not the dram I was looking for.... Great start with the nose, but all that salt afterwards... I won't be buying this one again. **50**/100",0

If you really want to save money avoid living downtown. uOttawa, Carleton, Algonquin, and St Paul's all include a mandatory bus pass in the tuition and you can get around fine using the bus.

Uh, so every time I've had drunken sex I was actually raped? Let's be real here, it's not on everyone else to monitor a person's intoxication and make decisions for them. If you're going to get so drunk that you offer to sleep with me when you probably would not have casual sex otherwise, that's on you, not me. How am I to always know whether you're too impaired to make a decision for yourself?

Obviously I'm not going to fuck someone who's so intoxicated they aren't equal participants (i.e passed out, not fully aware of surroundings, acting erratically etc), but if a girl is actively seducing me, it sure as hell isn't rape. If I knew for a fact she was doing something she wouldn't want to normally, I would say no as a point of honour.

"Yes, you can plug the drives in in any combination. Whichever one is booted from will be the active OS drive, and the rest will just be storage drives with a dormant OS on it.

The only issue you might have going back to the 2TB backup is programs. Most programs installed to the 4TB will also make registry changes on the SSD's installation. If you then not from the 2TB drive then those registry values won't exist and programs that depend on those values won't run.

My suggestion, after the SSD is up and running, wipe the 2TB drive, make an image of your SSD, and store it on the 2TB or 4TB drive. Then, if the SSD dies or the OS gets hosed you can just restore that image. Periodically remake the image so it doesn't fall to far behind.

Also, sign up for DropBox or GoogleDrive and save your important documents in the cloud. They will be automatically synched so you have an off-site, professionally-managed backup of critical documents.",0

I had depression during the first portion of my college years and ended up flunking a lot of classes. I was placed on academic probation and was seeing a counselor for suicidal tendencies and self harm. This was a drastic change from high school, where I was rank #2 out of my entire class and had full ride scholarship offers. I was able to make positive changes very slowly and eventually improved my grades. I had to retake a lot of courses of course but I still graduated on time by taking summer courses. I remember feeling as if I had ruined my entire life already so why now remove myself from the equation? Please believe me when I say your life isn't ruined. You'll be able to pay these bills off.

No, no it did not.  The moon was created ~4.5 billion years ago, shortly after the formation of the earth itself.  The crust was probably still cooling.

"Laziness is great. Building up seqs recursively with `lazy-seq` can be super elegant - I recently wrote code to fetch a lazy sequence of items from a list key in [Redis](http://redis.io), transparently fetching in batches, for when the size of the whole list may exceed memory on the client which is pretty nifty. Clojure's lazy seq stuff made the code pretty clean and a breeze to write.

However, I wish I spent more time really studying it and deeply understanding things like head retention and memoization earlier when I was getting started, which I've been bitten by many times (many of our datasets are larger than available memory). If you incorrectly handle a large lazy seq, things will explode and youll run out of memory.

The vast majority of Clojure's core functions return lazy seqs (when applicable); it's usually called out on [clojuredocs.org](http://clojuredocs.org) (e.g., see [map](http://clojuredocs.org/clojure.core/map)), and I've spent a surprising amount of time digging through [clojure's core.clj](https://github.com/clojure/clojure/blob/master/src/clj/clojure/core.clj) to verify details for myself.

I've only been bitten once or twice by things not evaluating when I expected them to, eg.

    (let [foo (range 10)]
      (map fn-with-side-effects foo) ; Won't run! Need `doall` or `doseq`
      :baz)

Again, head retention is super important to watch out for. A naive example:

    (def huge-coll (range 1e10))
    (println (count huge-coll))
    ; Uh oh! huge-coll is lazy, but since we used `def` its head is
    ; retained and taking up tons of memory",0

What surprised me was a young gay man stood up and said he supported UKIP as Muslims disliked gay people, and he thought their position on immigration would limit homophobia from the Muslim community.

This scene definitely happened - I'm just unsure if it's from the exact programme I mentioned above. But whichever programme it came from, I was shocked by this attitude on so many levels.

"The paper might be bad, but they should have said nothing about gender.  They could have said that the paper was methodologically weak and ideologically biased.

Since the paper was about gender differences in the PhD to postdoc transition, the reviewer probably could have said that getting some input from men would be valuable.  Just as a paper about gender differences authored only by men might benefit from the reverse advice.

The speculation about stamina and work hours was inappropriate and barely related to the peer review.

EDIT: I'm now putting it together that the paper was about gender differences in the PhD to postdoc transition.  So I suppose the snippets might be relevant to the submitted study, and not just a commentary on the gender of the authors.  If the study concluded that there was sexism in academia, it makes sense that alternative explanations should have been investigated.  So I'm going to say it sounds bad, but perhaps not as bad in context.  I'll reserve judgement.",0

Also, here's the wiki version of the timeline.

&gt; According to the police timeline, Gray was in a transport van within 11 minutes of his arrest, and within 30 minutes, paramedics were summoned to take Gray to a hospital.[2] There were four confirmed stops the van took while Gray was detained. At 8:46 a.m., Gray was unloaded to be placed in leg irons, police citing Gray was ""irate"". Another stop, recorded by a private camera, shows the van stopped at a grocery store. At 8:59 a.m., a second prisoner was placed in the vehicle while officers checked on Gray's condition, and 27 minutes later the van makes its final stop so paramedics can transport an unconscious Gray to the hospital.[17] He was taken to the University of Maryland R Adams Cowley Shock Trauma Center, in a coma.

Nothing in there about an ""extra 38 minutes to potentially injure the guy"" but there is a trip to the grocery store.",0

"It's an idea which originated in a comic, not academic research, intended to make a rhetorical point, not actually function as a test to measure how misogynistic movies are.

As such, it does draw attention to a real tendency in movies. however, the implication that this is misogyny is a bit of a leap.

There are many factors at play. Gender roles absolutely result in some of those factors. however it's not simply anti-woman. It's restrictive assumptions and expectations placed on both men and women.

I ranted about this at great length here: http://www.reddit.com/r/FeMRADebates/comments/2uu7pp/genre_responsibility_empathy_value_and_women_in/

Movies with many important female characters are generally intended for female audiences and these are generally romances, so obviously most conversations will be about the (male) love interest.",0

"I should clarify my point.  I agree with you when you say that ethnic tribalism is something to consider.  But you seem to have been arguing that ethnic tribalism is good and *should* be the only thing to consider.  I am not just arguing that class is a factor, but that class should be *the* most important factor in solidarity and pan-ethnic struggle.  

For example, it doesn't make any sense at all for low-wage South Asian workers to ally themselves with the South-Asian-lead business councils and lobbyist groups--their interests are entirely opposite.  It does make sense, however, for them to ally with Latino immigrants, for example.  

Likewise, back in the '60s, it *should* have made sense for White and Black workers in midwestern industrial cities to ally with one another--but too many White workers were held back because of their racial tribalism and White supremacist attitudes, and everybody was weakened because of it.  On other other, during this same time period, many Black and White people in the ghettos of Chicago successfully organized alongside one another to address issues of poverty and police violence, and forged an incredibly powerful alliance.

All in all, I would argue that economic dynamics are hugely influential in impacting how social and political dynamics play out.  As such, organizing with class in mind can and should be a way to cut across racial lines and fight for a better world.",0

My point was that the Phillies are hobbled by the gambles that they took giving big contracts to guys like Howard, Utley, and Lee, who are all making a ton of money and barely playing quad A level ball (if playing at all), but who can't be moved.  As a result of the choices the front office made to keep those few players with the organization, it's going to be a long road to rebuild back to a competitive level.  While it's a different scenario, it comes down to the same principle - it's very to risk all of your resources - whether those resources are financial or player skill - just to make sure you land one or two guys, particularly when you're then left with insufficient resources to let you surround those guys with sufficient complimentarily skilled players to make the whole thing succeed.

"Is it that big a deal that it was suggested they bring on the opposite gender to help remove bias from a study on gender differences? I mean it makes sense to me.

It's not like they were doing a paper on the migration patterns of exotic birds or anything, it was specifically related to gender and therefore there is a strong likelihood that the results could contain bias if only one of the genders is actually doing the study. Getting a male author could eliminate that problem.

I do find it kind of ironic that the women were told they were biased and so they instantly complained they were victims of sexism. To me that is just a clear indication that they were indeed biased, like they were looking for it (called confirmation bias). It's a research study! They should be scientists first and women second, science is about being objective and looking at facts not about what you want to be the case.",0

"It doesn't need to be a unique solution. Let me give you a really simple example of why this is a brute force method. Human error is irrelevant. X + Y = 150, brute force on this is guess and test every combination of X and Y that makes the equation true. There isn't a unique key and the simple algorithm is choose a value for X, then 150 - X = Y. For a base, you just choose an attack comp, see how it does, then choose a new comp if you don't think it is going to lead to a possible solution. You just have to choose random values for more than one variable (i.e. deployment, troop/spell loadout, etc). 

&gt;Often times after spending 30 minutes trying to figure out a base you are forced to give up and move on to the next target.

If we are talking about free, unlimited sandboxing, 30 minutes is far less than the amount of time I would expect people to put into practicing on a base. A good base I would imagine would take a few hours. A great base I would imagine would take a more sizable chunk of time. If they are giving up after 30 minutes, they aren't really taking advantage of the tool and aren't really determined to find a 2/3 star strategy. Nothing is forcing you to give up and move on.

&gt;I'd prefer more multiplayer variety in an online game... but I'd take anything that actually adds more actual gameplay.

Agreed, although I don't think there's a way without hurting the multiplayer aspect, although....

&gt;I believe most have this notion because of the unfair advantage created by cheats. Had the game been originally designed with practice attacks I think people would see it very differently. Getting more use and game time out of your 3 hour army build can be designed in a way that is positive for the gamer.

That's a good point and it might be more widely accepted if they had implemented in the beginning. At least not including traps and CC in a sandbox attack would at least help make it so there was something still unexpected in the base. I would be surprised though if the developers never thought of the idea for a practice attack mode and just didn't find an effective way of balancing it",0

"&gt; Fonseca says...  it was a moment to vent frustration over what they see as economic injustice... They profit off of us, he says, but they give nothing back.

First of all, the idea that wanton destruction of people's businesses, property, and livelihoods can be reduced to ""vent[ing]"" is as disgusting as it is laughable. Most immigrant small businesses operate on incredibly slim margins, and it isn't unheard of for much smaller crises than riots to force many to close their doors. In the LA riots of 1992, less than a quarter of Korea Town's businesses ever opened up again, to say nothing of the emotional damage suffered by the people who lived there. Calling rioting ""vent[ing]"" is supremely reductive and frankly disrespectful to the people who invested their lives and the lives of their families to make their businesses possible and sustainable.

Secondly, I wonder how familiar the person being quoted is with the actual inner operations of Asian American small businesses. I wonder if he is aware that the majority of Asian American small business owners don't even take a salary and most of their employees are family members who don't get paid either. They literally pay the rent, utilities, and operating costs of their businesses, and pay the rent and utilities of their home, using whatever is left to pay for food and gas, and saving what small amount they can in order to pay for their children's education and very likely neglecting their own retirement.

There's a reason why Asian small businesses seem so insular: it's because they are literally family businesses wherein the ""employees"" accept law-breaking hours, get paid in food and shelter, and literally live and work under the same roofs.",0

"Here are my thoughts on how EMDrive works that I posted on another thread.

&gt;I've experimented with a similar idea using objects instead of electromagnetic radiation.

&gt;The law of conservation is not being broken, instead what is happening is that the ""equal and opposite reaction"" is happening at different time intervals.

&gt;What is essentially happening is that when the microwaves hit a wall, they push the device in that direction, and the reflected microwave then goes towards the cavity that is V shaped. This cavity causes the reflection to be only partially cancelled, and as it continues bouncing around it gets cancelled completely over time.

&gt;It takes small incremental steps, but with the billions of microwaves being reflected, it appears to be a continuous movement.

&gt;Try an experiment at home, get on a computer chair and lift your legs up. Now without touching the floor try moving the chair by kicking. Your chair will move due to friction, but if you notice, it will move forward then back. This device basically just slows down the ""going back"" part. So, if you keep going forward faster than the chair wanting to go back, you can create movement in vaccuum/space.

Regi did what they had to do, and a mixture of the strain on their relationship, chaox being hurt from regi benching him, neither one of them wanting to particularly come forward to the other and how close they once were just made for one of those situations that people tend to stop talking all together.

There is probably no 'bad blood' now. They more than likley dont talk now through having very little to talk about as well as no reason to start talking again. Chaox was hurt, Regi was also hurt, both just pushed passed it the way they deal with things and I guess never looked back.

Its a shame because if Chaox didnt take a break after getting benched hed have gotten on another team no bother (because Xpecial made him look amazing, and any team woulda picked him up) and hed have gotten more of a chance to work on his performance.

"That's just part of the EU project though - the richest countries are able to help direct (a small in the grand scheme of Western government budgets) amounts of money to poorer areas of all the countries to raise standards in those areas.

The entire point is that the richest countries help out. If we were a net recipient of EU funding we wouldn't be having a conservation about whether the EU is right for us because we'd want to be in it so we could move to Germany.

But because countries are only wealthy in general and often include areas of much larger deprivation sometimes net contributors benefit from those kinds of programmes. It's embarrassing really that there are even areas so deprived in Britain that the EU has even needed to designate some of them as convergence zones.

"GIF is a ""normal"" image format like many others including JPG, TIFF and PNG.  GIF was probably the most common format on the early web.  It works best where there are large areas of the same colour and its limit of 256 colours tends not to be an issue for maps.  It's a lossless format so all those hard edges common in maps reproduce correctly whereas JPG, designed more for real-world images, tends to leave artifacts.  GIF is also very old and simple so browser support is assured.

PNG was the successor format to GIF, pushed by issues around patents that have since expired.  It has better compression and other advantages but I suspect Google went with GIF for its maps early on when browser support for PNG was not quite good enough.

For all those webmasters out there hosting sites displaying logos and similar artwork with only a few solid colours as JPG files, that's probably the wrong thing to do; PNG or GIF is a better choice.  Leave JPG for photographic images.  Even at quite high quality settings (and large file sizes) JPG can mess up the clean edges common in logos.",0

"We're 25. She definitely has some sort of block where she thinks I am out of her league (she has said as much, ""you're out of my league,"" and not in a fun-compliments kind of way). I don't mean this in an actually-narcissistic way, but I think at the start of our relationship she was sort of enthralled by me, because to strangers I apparently come across as very aloof and certain of myself (so she says), and I am more ""conventionally attractive"" than her (aka more feminine, she's more like an outdoorsy tomboy and doesn't get attention about her appearance). She'll talk about sex in a distant clinical way if I bring it up, but she gets really, really embarrassed by *sexual talk* if you get what I mean. And, our talks about sex are always initiated by me as she has nothing to contribute about it. She has a really deep issue with shame surrounding being turned on or having desire, and as such has no fantasies or anything to share with me. Of course, she also refuses to go to any kind of therapy. Ironically, I am the one who was raised Catholic where she was raised Atheist! (Obviously I didn't stick with *that*!) I hope for her sake that if we do split up she can find some sexual nirvana with someone else, but as it sits now I really do think it's either not there, or locked away so tightly she'd need genuine sex therapy to coax it out. But, to her credit we have had some really good, really healing conversations recently where she has appeared to understand my angle better. Doesn't mean it is actually changing at all in practice.

&gt;Do you feel like you guys can have really hard conversations without blowing up?

It's like playing minesweeper. Sometimes it'll go well, sometimes she'll say really snide underhanded hurtful things and then be like ""oh I just meant x"" and claim I'm invalidating her feelings if I get angry about it and ~boom~. Not that I'm perfect, I do get defensive. Actually, a lot of our sex problems started in conjunction with us fighting *a lot* because she used to blow up at me over tiny things (like, buying the wrong brand of pasta sauce...) but that doesn't happen anymore. She is still a generally high-strung person but she doesn't snap passive-aggressively these days. I'm not painting a very flattering picture of her here, but we barely fight because I told her I would break up with her on two separate occasions if she didn't cut it out, and we worked on ways for us both to create a less tense environment when there is a problem. Nonetheless, I think in light of all these sex problems I just feel... exhausted. Like, we worked so hard on the fighting thing, and the sex thing insidiously crept up at the same time, and now the fighting thing feels *fixed*, like okay she can get bitchy but it's a normal level (I think) and we communicate so much better. But then there's this now. It's like there's always something else to struggle with. EDIT: Additionally it also makes me feel like a crazy evil nag, because this marks Incident #3 of abcde telling her girlfriend ""this might end our relationship""! She's said to me ""you don't love me for who I am"" and ""I've changed so much for you."" Is she... wrong? Maybe not! And that feels pretty awful. Of course, what she changed was tbh kind of abusive behaviour!

*Further developed* is an excellent way to put it. I have thought long and hard about sex, I have written, read, watched and fantasized about porn, I have fooled around with people casually. I thought that would be okay, that she could just blossom *with* me, I'd never had *good* sex either at the time and it only seemed logical that people take a while to be comfortable. I have learned my lesson. I don't think I'd ever date someone sexually inexperienced again, either, and if I did, it would not be monogamously, and I would keep an eye out for these kinds of hang-ups.

 * 35g of Protein

 * 9.5g of Carbs

**Servings:**

 * 2 people

**Prep Time:**

 * 15 minutes

**Cook Time:**

 * 1 hour

**Ingredients:**

 * 1 spaghetti squash

 * 4 sausage links

 * 2 tbsp coconut oil

 * 1/2 red bell pepper

 * 1/2 green bell pepper

 * 1 egg

 * 2 oz white cheddar cheese

 * 2 tbsp parmesan

 * 1 tsp basil

 * 1 tsp crushed red pepper

 * 1/2 tsp garlic powder

 * 1 tsp salt

 * 1/2 tsp pepper

 * 1 tbsp fresh parsley

**Instructions:**

 * First, we’re going to prepare our spaghetti squash. Preheat the oven to 375°F.

 * Wash and slice (this is a laborious process) the squash horizontally into 1 inch rings. Lay them out on a baking sheet lined with parchment paper and sprinkle with olive oil, salt and pepper.

 * Bake in the oven for about 40 minutes.

 * While it’s baking, let’s prepare the add ins. Cook your sausage links in a pan oiled with coconut oil on a medium-high heat until they’re brown on all sides (about 10 minutes). Whether or not they’re fully cooked, take the off the heat and let them rest for a minute.

 * While they’re resting, add some chopped peppers onto the pan to become tender.

 * While the peppers are cooking, slice your sausages into about ½ inch pieces and then add them to cook and marinade with the peppers.

 * At this point, add all the spices you’d like! We added salt, pepper, garlic powder, crushed red pepper, and basil.

 * When the bake time for the squash is up, you should notice the tops of each squash ring are darker and more saturated looking. This means the strands are loose enough to “spaghettify”.

 * Using a fork, tug away at the insides of the squash from it’s flesh. You should end of with little mounds of what looks just like spaghetti!

 * Throw in all the spaghetti squash to the pan and toss to combine. Let all the flavors incorporate.

 * Add in chunks of about 2 oz of white cheddar cheese. Stir to help melt them. Lower the heat to medium-low and let simmer covered for a few minutes.

 * Lastly, turn the heat off and crack an egg into the mix. Make sure to keep stirring and tossing the mix to not let much of the egg cook all at once. Stirring often will ensure the mix is creamy and fully covered instead of a large piece of fried egg in a corner.

 * Spoon a heaping helping into a plate and garnish with fresh, chopped parsley and Parmesan cheese. Enjoy your Low-Carbonara!

"In terms of general strength of the species:  
No Balrog was ever described as being killed without the killer also perishing in the fight: Glorfindel, Ecthelion and Gandalf all died doing so. Two of the greatest First Age warriors and a Maiar. The only other time I can find any were killed was in the War of Wrath where it is merely written that ""The Balrogs were destroyed.""  
Dragons on the other hand seem to be capable of being killed by much lesser fighters. Glaurung was killed by Turin who survived-ish doing so, Ancalagon ""mightiest of the dragon-host"" was slain by Earendil who similarly survived. Then of course Bard slaying Smaug. None of these fighters are similar in prowess to Ecthelion or Glorfindel.  
So I'd say in terms of relative power that Balrogs are stronger than dragons, and Smaug is a much weaker dragon than many others. Another point would be dragons' need for rest, Glaurung is killed while sleeping, Smaug is sleeping in the first encounter with Bilbo, so I think they do fatigue, whereas Durin's Bane is capable of fighting for 10 days straight.  
However, Smaug does have the power of flight which could give him the advantage in larger battlefields, and as said Durin's Bane in the movie only has weapons of fire (although I can see no proof the whip is fiery in the books.)  
I think Durin's Bane would take the first round due to the confinement.  
Second round could be even, Smaug can take to the skies, but equally can't really do a huge amount to DB without getting close as breathing fire won't do much, I think fatigue might decide this in favour of DB.  
Third round's a tad ambiguous, Moria's a big place. 21st Hall with it's confinement would be similar to Erebor, Balrog win. The Bridge of Khazad-Dum and I think Smaug could do enough to collapse the bridge underneath DB, which I think you'd probably count as a win for Smaug, DB won't die certainly, but he's not gonna be fighting back.

Smaug wins the bonus round, anyone voiced by Bendict Cumberbatch is gonna win. Book-wise the ability to control darkness would be a pretty cool thing for DB to pull out though.

I'm a giver, sometimes to a fault.

Whether he intended harm isn't the question, as the road to hell is paved with good intentions.  Leopards do not change their spots, especially when said leopard has been assessed by various peers as borderline autistic.

Yours is definitely one style of leadership and a style that works every day. Les's style at LSU is obviously a different one. 

Just analyzing Les's style, it clearly works with many guys, as several players LSU puts on these lists completely turn their college careers around, some even becoming captains. With others, it never worked (as noted by some Texans fans in here who drafted two of them). No strategy works with 100% of people 100% of the time. 

At the end of the day, players continue committing to LSU and they send more underclassmen to the league than anybody, so whatever they are doing, for the most part, it seems to be working.

Of course there isn't, I'm not trying to say there is. I'm honestly having a hard time finding the right words to state what I mean. There's absolutely nothing wrong with being autistic. 

&gt;It's my understanding that people transition because they have suicidal thoughts and literally cannot live outside of the gender role they're transitioning to.

Yes, absolutely many of them do. But some do so because they just feel more comfortable as the opposite gender. And many do feel suicidal thoughts about it, but they don't necessarily have *physical pain* when they hear their birth pronouns.

I've not done any research on bacteria and viruses that can survive a hard, cold vacuum - but those would be the culprits in making something inedible after billions of years.

Enemy troop movement in the caves suggest a eminent attack. Platoons poor out of the warpgate and move straight for your Interlink.You rally troops to intercept the enemy and prepare to defend the base .You bring even pop to the fight and since you're defending you have the upper hand. Wave after wave of enemy forces smash off your troops making no progress .While defending the base you notice your NTU/ resources levels are low. Enemy infiltrators have installed a virus and destroyed all the turrets causing NTU levels to drop fast. The enemy couldn't break threw the defense so they decided to starve us of resource so the base would lose power and to go neutral giving the attackers a much needed advantage.After you notice the NTU drain you send 2 squads back to the warpgate with air and armor defense for a ant run.2 mins left before the NTU runs out and the loadstars are in the air with the ants in back.The armor and air left the warp gate mins before ,and are clearing out the enemy armor and air in and around the NTU silo. As the loadstars fly over the base  you make the call for friendly  emp's to go off to clear the way for the ants,and with seconds left the NTU silo is refiling and the base is safe, or so you thought. While you were planning your NTU run the enemy planned a max crash and sent 4 infiltrators into your basement to setup routers, and now  the enemy is 50 strong in your gen with 25 maxes standing next to your blown up generator .",0

A few years ago I was an optimistic futurist.

"At twelve I was watching whatever I could get my grubby paws on, but it was all mainstream. It didn't have to be extreme for me to realise that I was consuming imagery that was intentionally produced in a certain way, defined by peculiar traits and portraying sex as something polished, brutish and alien which I couldn't relate to in any meaningful sense. Amateur videos were much more interesting to me but curiously less arousing at that age, because I hadn't yet made the full connection between emotion and sex. My arousal depended entirely upon the visual, and I had no past experience to draw feelings from when I masturbated. So I knew from the beginning that my association with sex through porn was abstract and divorced from reality. What i really wanted was amateur porn of genuine teenagers my age having sensual, awkward sex of the kind I imagined, which of course didn't exist. I craved educational porn, I suppose, but what was available most easily was porn involving leggy blonde women of indeterminate age getting fucked mercilessly by brutish men who even then I felt disgusted looking at, performing the same litany of acts and positions over and over again. I remember thinking many times ""is this it?"" and ""where's the loving and the cuddling?"" It's interesting that I managed to distance myself from it as much as I did, considering how much I was watching. I was always thinking to myself ""could I ever do that to a girl?"" ""Is that really what I will be expected to do?"" ""How can that possibly be enjoyable?"" etc, questions like that. It turned me off, and yet I doubted my own feelings because this stuff seemed like it was everywhere. ""Surely, it must be me that's weird for not liking the idea of anal sex"" and stuff like this.

One side affect of porn that's affected me is the third person perspective. When you're having sex, you can't see the same angles that you can see in porn, and it made me realise how much I had begun to rely on those angles and those movements that porn focuses on. Together with the death grip problem, and finding that I was trying to replicate the feeling of masturbation through PIV, it made it difficult to come and I think that's when I first started to understand the negative effects of watching years of pornography from beginning of my sexually active life.

Good luck, you may fail numerous times but each time you get back up and start again you will be a little bit more determined. The thing to remember is, you are armed against it now. You understand the effects and that is a shield in itself.",0

Section 5. [**Book It!**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pizza_Hut#Book_It.21) of article  [**Pizza Hut**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pizza%20Hut): [](#sfw) 

---

&gt;Pizza Hut has been a sponsor of the ""Book It!"" reading incentive program for children since the program's launch in 1984.  Students who read books according to the goal set by the classroom teacher, in any given month from October through March, are rewarded with a Pizza Hut certificate good for one free, one-topping Personal Pan Pizza. Some psychologists have criticized the program on the grounds that it may lead to [overjustification](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Overjustification_effect) and reduce children's intrinsic interest in reading.  However, a study of the program found that participation in the program neither increased nor decreased reading motivation.  The program's 25th anniversary was in 2009. The Book It! program in Australia ceased in 2002 when Pizza Hut in Australia was removing its dine-in stores as Australians opted for take away pizza instead of dine-in.

"A few things;

* Gear doesn't matter at your current level, it matters at a 100
* Switching to Arms or Fury might be a better idea once you reach a 100 or are finding it hard to tank without people getting up your butt about mistakes. Being a damage dealer in a group setting is a lot less pressure because you aren't expected to know much of anything
* Join a social guild that has a raid team and see if they will let you learn the ropes. At end game there are a number of different types of guilds; strictly social ones that don't raid, social ones that have raid teams, casual raiding guilds that raid norm/heroic, semi hardcore guilds that raid heroic and dabble in mythic and progression guilds that are focused on clearing mythic. My advice is to try and get into a social or casual raiding guild as they explore more elements of the game and are often friendlier. 
* Each dungeon and raid boss has a loot table with various drops that will vary from kill to kill. In dungeons and looking for raid, all loot is personal. In raids at the norm/heroic/mythic level there is an option to have that loot on master looter or personal, with most choosing the first option.
* Once you hit a 100 there are a few ways to gear; you can randomly queue for pvp battlegrounds which will award you honor which you can the spend at a vendor to buy 620 ilvl gear. You can queue for normal dungeons at level 100 when your ilvl is below 610, once it is above that, you can queue for heroic dungeons which drop 630 gear. I think that the best path for you would be to enter some random pvp battlegrounds for that honor gear I mentioned, until your ilvl is above 610. From there, queue up for heroic dungeons to farm 630 gear. Above that, there is the Looking For Raid option which allows you experience the Highmaul and Blackrock Foundry raids and they drop epic gear.

Out of the all of the above, the finding the right guild is probably going to be the most challenging. I suggest joining a social guild at the moment, and once youre at a 100 and at a decent ilvl 650 +, looking at finding a guild on your server that is raiding at a casual level. The best way to do this is to look on the guild recruitment forums or realm forum on the blizz website.

Good luck! Hit me up with your battletag if you want to have some help in game.  ",0

"Dude, so-called ""hot"" blondes suck big fat donkey penis.

I remember when I used to think they were the ""hottest.""  That's when I believed there was such a thing as ""most attractive.""  There isn't.  Everyone has flaws.  There is what you're attracted to, and what you're turned off by.  The reason I was even attracted to them in the first place was because of their presence in the mass media.  There were always hot blonde bimbos running around on TV being featured as ""the best,"" or hottest.


The more you narrow your attraction criteria in an arbitrary, irrational manner, the less opportunities you have.

From **[labtestsonline](http://labtestsonline.org/understanding/analytes/diabetes-auto/tab/test#what)**:

&gt;If no diabetes-related autoantibodies are present, then it is unlikely that the diabetes is type 1. 

The insulin dosage is not high, more like T1 levels, but I'll let the T1s comment on that. The goal of 160 is a bit loose, especially if your post-prandial test is not at your peak time.

"Don't blame Telstra - Ziggy stated 15 years ago that Telstra's copper was ""5 minutes to midnight"" (his words). That's why they started rolling out HFC, which got canned when the NBN deals were brokered.

Now the NBN has been scrapped, and we're left with a network that Telstra has been doing minimal maintenance on for the last 15 years, due to a planned obsolescence.

Abbott has then gone ahead and balanced Australia's future on this dying network. Oh, and did I mention they sued TPG for rolling out it's own fibre once they canned FTTH NBN? In the end, it's the government that's fucked the network, not Telstra.

"(Copy-pasting my own comment from /r/games from this video)

I feel that the issue is not paid mods in and of itself, **the issue is that they did it with Skyrim**.

&amp;nbsp;

Skyrim is nearly synonymous with modding in PC gaming circles. When you say you're going to play Skyrim a common response is ""With what mods?"". As Skyrim gets older, more and better mods come out, and this solidifies itself more and more. When people play Skyrim on PC they are expecting a modded, customizable experience rather than just the base game. When people are getting into downloading mods for the first time, it's usually with Skyrim.

&amp;nbsp;

Then comes the Paid Workshop. Suddenly what players got for free and already had an expectation of, now must be paid for. To many, it felt like content was being removed from a game years after launch and then put behind another paywall. 

Yes, they did only pay for the base game. However because Skyrim's launch was *years ago* the mods have become ingrained into many people's experiences with the game, emotionally identical and expected. Skyrim Steam Workshop is the place many first-time-mod-consumers go, and for them to see that some mods require payment gives them a wrong and jaded view of the entire rest of the modding scene.

&amp;nbsp;

Another factor in this is fear and worry as a player. Like many others, I never finished the Skyrim main story. I have it downloaded on my PC right now; I play it every now and then. I felt apprehension not knowing if I'd be locked out of the mods I already downloaded when I next started up the game. I also felt that I should play it immediately and 'finish' it before more mods become paid for and I lose access to them. This rushed experience is of course not complementary to the game.

&amp;nbsp;

In conclusion, I feel that a game this old and this ingrained in the mod scene was a bad game to start with. I feel that an example of a better introduction of the Paid Workshop would be with the next Elder Scrolls. No expectations, no (real or perceived) removal of content, and mods can be bigger and better with the knowledge of financial security.",0

"Amiibos are basically action figures of Nintendo characters originally intended for Smash Bros, where you could tap the figure's base onto the GamePad and play against/train an AI player and then save it onto a small chip in the base by tapping it onto the GamePad again. 

In HW, you can tap TLoZ amiibos (Link, Zelda, Shiek, Ganondorf) at the title menu once a day to receive weapons for that character. In some cases, they can drop upgraded weapons (I got a Triforce Spinner from my Zelda Amiibo the first time I used it, but since then it's been lots of rapiers). Non-Zelda themes amiibos drop other random things, ranging from 1-50k Rupees or various materials.

My wife (who was my girlfriend at the time) explicitly asked me NOT to get her a diamond ring, after watching some special on diamonds.

Diamonds have no innate value, they are not a rare stone at all, the supply is just artificially restricted. If diamond market was ""free"", the value of diamond is estimated to be about $5/karat).
Maybe let her watch a documentary on diamond, and present her with a spectacular sapphire ring. A much more beautiful rare stone can be had for $2-3k.

"&gt; Contrary to Israeli daydreaming, there are is no legal difference between major settlements bordering Jerusalem or deep in the West Bank.

"You seem to be the one making fun of yourself because you are acting childish and naive. This is very much a debate. Look up the definition of the word “debate” if you wish. Or if you are too lazy (which you seem to appear to be because of lack of comprehension of my comments) 

**debate** [*dih-beyt*] **noun** a discussion, as of a public question in an assembly, involving opposing viewpoints. 

*-Dictionary.com*

I am not arguing against a bike’s legal right to be on the road. If you actually think that then you did not read my last few comments. Here, I will say it again. Bikes have a legal right to traverse the roads.

Bikes cause traffic! Get that one fact through your thick skull. That is what I was arguing and you failed to comprehend that. Several comments later you finally realize this fact and then the argument was over. The debate had ended and I had proven my point. You agreed to my viewpoint by saying

 &gt; I never said shit about cyclists not causing traffic.

Which is a sort of lie because our previous argument was how cars have to navigate around cyclists to pass, and that causes traffic jams. You did “*say shit*” because you kept refusing to admit that this act of slowing down, waiting for a clearing, and then passing, takes time can cause a massive buildup of traffic. Whatever the reason, you admitted that Cyclists do in fact cause traffic jams. So this debate is over. 

The link you provided is the first actual piece of argument material you have presented thus far. Good job. I’m actually very proud of you. Things like this are a key part of a healthy debate (Which I stated earlier is what our conversation is). However, the article you provided seems very biased in their study because it is a website dedicated to cyclists. I will agree that there is data supporting both our viewpoints (even yours!). The fact of the matter is Bikes do cause traffic jams. To what degree is arguable and will vary depending on location. We cannot argue data like this because it will lead nowhere. 

For example. I could show an anti-vaxer loads of evidence why vaccines are good yet they would not believe me. These arguments can get nowhere because the anti-vaxer can summon up their own study that supports their ideas. Thus no ground is made. You in this case are the anti-vaxer.

Maybe it is different in different places but where I live. Cyclists create big traffic jams that are an inconvenience. I don’t like traffic jams. So I don’t like cyclists. You are a cyclist. So I don’t like you. (I feel like I am repeating myself). You cannot really argue my points. They are all 100% fact. That’s like arguing the sky isn't blue or that cats don’t have fur.

Have a nice day. I do not wish to continue this debate for it is over. If you have a problem with this statement 

**“Cyclists on the road can create traffic jams”**

then you are to far gone and I cannot speak with you. I will end this debate with a quote from George Carlin. 

*“Never argue with an idiot. They will only bring you down to their level and beat you with experience.”*

p.s Sorry for calling you an idiot, think of it as pay back for your prior “name call” of me.

"I believe the answer is yes. I am not an economist and this is an amateur opinion.

 Here's how I came to that conclusion:

Lets talk about rent. Lets say that we think people aren't living in good conditions, too many people have to live in crappy homes and we want to help them afford better homes. So we just hand out cash. To everybody. What happens? Are there suddenly more homes for people to move into?

No. The number of homes is the same. And the landlords, they realize that everybody has more money, so they can raise their rent. So rent goes up. Now we're back in the same situation we were in before. People still can't afford rent, and giving them money wont help because landlords will just raise the rent.

That was a very crappy example, but it serves to show the point. Strip away all the nonsense in the situation I described: we aren't actually handing out money to people.

The point remains: if we increase the amount of money people get, sellers of goods and services will just raise their rent to compensate. It seems to me that if more money is being circulated, but the supply of goods doesn't increase, all that happens is you get inflation.

Now, there is the possibility that the increase in money will create a higher supply of goods. In the rent example from above, maybe some people will decide to create new housing to rent. But I don't think that the amount by which supply will increase will offset the effect of inflation. I am guessing inflation will win out.

"Safety play is less dependent on man coverage technique. It's more reading the offense and reacting. CBs have a similar responsibility in zone coverage but in man it's more being able to mirror your man's movement, without being fooled by head shakes, shimmies, false steps, etc. It's a much more reactionary and instinctual thing than watching the play developing in front of you and reacting to it. 

In order to stay with a sub 4.4 40 running WR, a CB needs elite speed and agility (hips). If he has this, most teams are willing to ignore poor tackling ability. A safety is normally playing off and can get by with lower levels of athleticism, with a lot more focus on his mental ability to read the play and tackling to finish it off",0

Same with Germany and Ireland. Those were areas that were far away from major trade routes, devoid of any unique resources, the weather was awful and not conducive to their way of life. 

If, however, those areas were pleasant to live in (and if they were there wouldn't have been wave after wave of people migrating into Imperial territories, leading to Hadrian building a wall for instance) chances are if Egypt, Israel, Carthage, The Greek Kingdoms, and Gaul all fell to Rome then so would the Scots, Irish and Germans...If the Romans wanted to live in those countries.

The Iranian Hostage Crisis was probably the biggest factor. This was from 1979-1981. 9/11 just refreshed what was already there. Orientalism probably had a big part in this. There existed an idea that Muslims were very different from those of us in the Christian West and so it was pretty easy to become attached to the idea that it was Islam that was responsible for the Iranian Hostage Crisis rather than any political issues. Those feelings were ignited again with 9/11. This is explained in greater detail in [Edward Said's books.](http://www.amazon.com/Edward-W.-Said/e/B001H6V71M),0

"I have done a lot of testing with stevia. One of the surprising properties is stevia is more hygroscopic than sugar so I found some baked goods are better and more moist with a little stevia mixed in. 

The downsides of stevia is the bitterness and it sucks with texture. The Splenda mix works way better for texture. 

You can try what you want, but I sell my baked goods so I need consistency  which means lots of testing. 

If you are baking, you are also using a lot of fat so I wouldn't worry about calories as much. However, I would say you could substitute up to 1/3 of the sugar with stevia (not the baking mix, but regular stevia) with minimal negatives and possibly more moist than sugar alone.",0

"hes not talking out of his ass, new cleaver promotes more less skill ceiling champs to be played, and nerfs further champs like Zed or Talon since they cant sit on brutalizer and get a cleaver when they need it. Phage is hella useless and the build path is awkward for every assassin.

Now we will have Gragas/ Sejuani etc (0 skill no brain champs) vs Vi/ Wukong etc which is the same but less tanky and more POINT CLICK cc which makes the game even more annoying to play since not even good reflexes qss save you (hello knockups on every new champ).

I guess Reddit rather have Kassadin midlane than LeBlanc because LeBlanc 'oneshots you' and kassadin does not (see SK vs FNC post-match thread where people cried about Fox oneshotting Steelback with 6 items nashor and 5 drakes).

The thing is this champs take 0 iq to play, 0 decision making and 0 mechanics, every player in the game above gold can get higher ranks just by saying in chat 'pls pick me sej i have all champs' since it gives an advantadge to the team.

He is right, he might not be as polite as le reddit fedoras want, but he is completely right.

And Riot is now buffing Shyvana, Trundle, already buffed Dr. Mundo, Ryze and every champ that can use the new cleaver properly (hello Darius + his ult changes) that make no sense whatsoever, 5.5 was the worst patch that Riot has ever made.

"I really know nothing about the home ownership scene, I rent, personally.

I can tell you a bit of my opinion on the crime. I've been an OK resident for five years about? I live in the NW quadrant of the city currently, and I'd say it's fine. Edmond and Bethany seem really good too.  Oklahoma city does have some weird stuff. I think some of the high crime rates have to do with a few things: lack of funding for social programs, really harsh crime policies, drug problems, and poverty levels. OKC in particular sits as a major trafficking platform because of the highways. Oklahoma has really harsh crime punishment, and as a fun fact, our incarceration rate for women is twice the national average, and half of oklahoma prisoners are incarcerated for nonviolent and property offenses. We also have about as many slot machines per capita as Nevada. (Does that tie into crime? I have no idea. I just thought about it.) And as far as gang violence goes, I know there are a few, but every large city has em. I've never actually really heard anything about gangs except some coworker talking about it being in the NW 122nd and Pennsylvania Ave. area.

I've lived Edmond, South Side, NW (asian district, plaza district), and in the past **five** years, my and my SO's direct experiences with crime:  
* Saw a fight break out with some homeless dudes next to the shelter.  
* My car was robbed once while I was at the mall, but I accidentally left the doors unlocked, so it was my own fault.  
* My car windows (and several on the street) were shot out back when I lived southside, and the car was egged.  
* Saw a dude get shot in the neck (knew it was a bad neighborhood) by some other dudes he was arguing with late one evening.  
* If you want to count it, I get approached by bozos at the gas station a lot for money.  

I would never say like I've really felt the majority of the city is unsafe. Southside can be a little rough, East side can be rough. I don't know many people who live in those quadrants though. I've heard stories about violent crimes that involve late nights, homeless populations, or occur on the east/south side. I've lived here five years, and I don't think anyone I know would say they think OKC is unsafe. I really like OKC a lot!

"&gt;So because some (not all) politicians in the UK are pedophiles, the government can't point out something another nation is doing? 

Exactly. They need to clean up their own house and shut the fuck up. They demand the same from everyone else, but they don't want to live up to their own standards; therefore they are hypocrites and make light of not just their own crimes, but any other wrongdoing committed by other nations too. Furthermore, this is as war has always been - it's not about ""who's right"" it's about ""who's resources we want to grab"" - so Britain and the five eyes and you, who will trip over himself to have the last word, can eat a barrel of dicks.

Young and dumb college-me decided I wanted a new (used) car, and looked around for a few weeks. Found one I liked at said giant Honda dealer, called to make sure they had it, and went it to look at it. Oops, it had sold at auction a few days ago. The salesman spent way too long trying to sell me on $10k cars, despite the fact that my upper limit was a firm $5k. That's cool, I didn't really need a new car anyway. But that didn't stop them from calling me everyday for 2 weeks!

Flash forward a few years to when my original POS got rear ended and totaled :( I was on the market for a Civic, so we decided to drop by that dealership. We asked the salesman what they had for under $8k (didn't specify any type of vehicle), and they quickly told us they didn't have any. Never mind the fact that we drove by several of them on our way on! The $8k just wasn't worth it to them.

Went to a dealer across town, and dropped $13k on an awesome Civic. I made damn sure to tell the first place all about the sale they lost. Jerks.

btw, 2-line kites are measured by their width across the canopy, and 4-liners are measured by their sq. area.  So the snapshot is 1.4 meters across, but is only a 0.7 sq meter in 4-line terms.

[I got exactly what I was going for]( http://imgur.com/b65vbZi),0
"I would bet if I knew villain made looser calls to 3-bets. Here's a [sample range](http://i.imgur.com/U1afe2K.png) of what villain could have if we knows he calls with hands like KQs and small pocket pairs. There are some combos removed because we have QQ and there's an ace on the flop, but 30 out of 74 combos in this sample range include an ace or have flopped a set. No matter what we bet, we're not getting those hands to fold. So 40% of the time, he will be calling or raising us. Given that betting half pot is usually a very weak bet size, we could bet 3/5 pot, as this size gives us more fold equity and only has to work 37.5% of the time for us to break even. If he folds all his non-aces and non-sets, which make up 60% of his range, then betting is a profitable play. We could check however, as we have 55% equity against this range. I favor betting, because checking allows villain to bet with almost all his range on the turn, and unless we turn a Q, we probably have to fold.

Edit: If we check back and villain bets the turn, we can call and hope it goes check-check on the river, but if he bets again, we're in a tough spot without a read. It comes down to your knowledge of villain's game and villain's perception of you. To call a turn bet and be able to call down on most rivers, then we need to know how often villain would bluff in this spot. We're crushed by all his value hands, so we would be calling down with a bluff-catcher. Calling the turn and folding the river would likely be more spewy than betting the flop, and to call down the turn, we kind of need to call the river as well (the spewiest line possible), which is why we can't call the turn without a read. Therefore, betting is the best option.",0

""But this is just plain stupid. You know he has an undefeated record and has won every time by knockout. He has at least 6 inches more of reach than you.""
""So?""
""So for fuck's sake, get it out of your fucking head that you will have any chance against him! You can't take this fight! It's been 4 years since you went to train on the East Coast, you're soft, there are no real fighters out where you've been!"" He's begun hyperventilating at this point. He doesn't even get this worked up when he coaches me, something is not right. ""What else is the problem?""
""What do you fucking mean the other problem? The problem is you'll lose!"" He's lying, he keeps pacing and playing with his watch.
""Why are you so against it?"" He stops pacing and looks at me. The look on his face is something I have never seen before and never will see again. His face showed a feeling of loss, depression, like something had broken inside of him. Sighing he sat down on the locker room bench across from me. Elbows on the knees of his sweatpants, his hands clasped in front of his face as if praying to god. Another long sigh and he starts his story.
""I wasn't always a boxing trainer. I used to work with monsters. Underground fighters all over the world would come to learn how to kill someone in a ring.""
This was a side of him I had seen before many matches ago. A side that had seen hell and created its demons.
""I found him while traveling the slums of India looking for fighters. I was looking for desperate men, the kind who have nothing and don't care, the kind that don't treat people like human beings. I wasn't looking for a kid. But I found one. A kid who had eyes that had seen things that no one should see.""
""How did you know he was going to be a fighter?""
""He came up to me and asked for change. One of the other trainers, Ed thought it would be funny to kick him in the face. Ed kicked out, the kid saw it, swayed to his inside and threw an uppercut that crushed Ed's balls. Ed went down and we were left there stunned. Without missing a beat, the kid started going through his pockets, rifling for valuables and money. When he was done he stood up and smiled at us and asked 'Change?'.""
""So you took him in and trained him?""
He nodded, ""I took a young boy, an innocent boy which fate had screwed over. And I raised him to fight, to win, to kill...He is my sin, and now the only reason he wants this fight is so he can prove that he's the best. Not you, or anyone else I've trained. I am begging you,"" He looked up at me, staring at me with teary eyes, ""don't fight him, you won't just lose the fight. You'll most likely die. Like I said, you've gotten soft. 4 years ago you stood a chance. Now? No way, no fucking way.""",0

"There are a lot of places where plural Marraige and same-sex Marraige present different legal challenges.  Marraige is a contract between two people.  The contract law behind this goes deep and would have to be worked out anew for plural marraige.

Let's deal with just one of these cases: survivorship.  Our laws deal with survivorship in a marraige assuming 1survivor.  A person can elect when starting social security to have dual survivorship so the SS is paid at a lower rate but is paid for the life of the person and the spouse.  

With plural marriage I could marry perhaps a woman and her daughter, claim SS with survivorship and expect both them to receive my check after I die for the length of both lives.  

This is a loophole that would have to be addressed; perhaps with a step down table reducing the amount further for each additional spouse, but whatever the answer, there is a bigger change of law required to adjudicate the variations possible with plural marraige.  ",0

"Corry's current group punishment was after an underaged 21 stole and crashed a golf cart in fort Walton. The golf cart owners pressed charges, and because the dollar amount is over some threshold, its grand theft auto.  He did all this without his buddy.

So they've got him on breaking the libo order, underage drinking, dui, and grand theft auto. The investigation found he was one of at least 9 Marines who were breaking the libo order that weekend. 

Group punishment sucks, and I've seen it abused at Corry. Capt Cooper and MGySgt Flynn are distinguished examples. Going through here as a JCACr now, I think the students don't know how easy they've got it. Try four months secured to base in cammies, with GySgt Eyre as your Platoon Commander. 

The current punishment seems fitting. I don't know what else could be as effective for a group of entry level students. There is/was a blatant and shared disregard for TECOM CGs libo policy.

"Fast charging works by two way communication between the charger and the battery, the battery will assess the state of each of its individual cells, and tell the charger about their charge level, temperature, and wear state. The lower the charge and temperature, the faster it can be charged without damage. There is also wear leveling between cells.  
 
Fast charging doesn't reduce overall battery life by much overall because of this. It's just opportunistic. If you had a dumb charger with that much wattage, yes, it would damage the battery, but the way this works, not so much.

&gt; My $.02 

&gt; My wife (who was my girlfriend at the time) explicitly asked me NOT to get her a diamond ring, after watching some special on diamonds. (Side note, diamond engagement ring is NOT a tradition, it's a result of a very successful marketing campaign by DeBeers, who essentially owns a monopoly on diamond production/distribution around the world. Diamonds have no innate value, they are not a rare stone at all, the supply is just artificially restricted. If diamond market was ""free"", the value of diamond is estimated to be about $5/karat).

&gt; Maybe let her watch a documentary on diamond, and present her with a spectacular sapphire ring. A much more beautiful rare stone can be had for $2-3k.

Parental relationships should not stay in a dominance mode. It's not that you're disrespecting them, you're just not agreeing with them. You can treat them the way you'd treat any other family member you disagree with. Your relationship with your parents is your own, and only you know them and can judge their moods, etc. But it's important to remember that they're not really authorities on anything, not even you. Arguments can only really exist if both people have it. I am not pretending it's easy, but you can simply agree to disagree. Usually that means ignoring anything they say that pisses you off, but that's something you often have to do with family. Getting heated is the cue to end the conversation and walk away. Interacting with your parents as an independent adult can range from no interaction at all to creepy. You're not smarter than your parents, but they aren't smarter than you, just older. You have different lives because you've had different experiences. 

Even if they won't try, peace can be found through understanding. Your understanding of them. Pretending to believe what they believe will fail, but accepting that they do in fact believe it will help you. Your job isn't to argue them out, or reason them in to any new beliefs. You just need to accept that they do believe crazy things and that those crazy beliefs will influence their behaviors. 

Ask them questions. Why is it so important to them that you do certain things? Why do they believe what they believe? Don't make it a confrontation, try to let it stay a conversation. Keep it clear that you are trying to have the exchange as an adult, not as their daughter. 

YMMV on this advice. ",0

"&gt; But a dictionary hardly seems to be a good reason for making laws to me.

Of course. I think there'd be a lot less objection, if sodomite relationships were given some legal recognition not using the word ""marriage"". Probably some people objecting would even *support* the legal changes if they didn't focus on sodomy to the exclusion of other relationships (eg, brother+sister, monks, hermits, nuns, non-sexual close-friends, etc).

&gt; Which might be ok if it was two 70 year old men we were talking about, but we're presumably talking about a straight couple. The woman is well past menopause. Do you feel they should be banned from getting married by law?

"that's a super generalized understanding of how the Communists seized power. people weren't pissed at land owners, they were pissed about power relations and given sufficient tools to shape the political and economic landscape to their own, they found all sorts of just-so rationales to do so. 'historical grudges' was, at the provincial level, a superficial ploy to seize land and wealth and political power. Mao may have believed his own ideals but the practical reality was that this allowed for Communist cadre to completely usurp local holdings with the promise that they would soon be the ones who were the community leaders, builders, and bankers

why do you think corruption is so systemic to the Chinese system? if people were really about grudges and wealth inequality then fuck me, you'd think China would at least be reasonably equitable but it's a far sight from what you'd call an egalitarian society. my great grandparents died in labor camps and my mother's side lost a fuckload of land and holdings during the revolt. and you can bet your ass that those holdings were not redistributed fairly to the community and you can bet your ass that my great grandparents weren't thrown in labor camps for ideology so much as their community standing

"Basically I ran with a crew of a few guys that got themselves into shit over and over again, after they got two different camps raided and destroyed in the span of two weeks I decided to branch out. (An example was that the leader of the group, Juicy, was threatening Spartan before I knew him to pick me up from the coast after I died)

The server was relatively small and the owner was a cool guy, I was on the coast and he moved a Military offroad to me (Which I dubbed Sasha) and told me they were having a BBQ in the bottom left of the map, they brought two Urals full of food and guns. Set up barricades, and set up some campfires.

I drove over there and some ass took potshots at us as I drove near to the point and I just gunned it there. While there I met someone who was typing in a convincingly russian manner. He told me that there were a couple of stray tents that people abandoned long ago near his base. After the BBQ we were driving out of town and someone popped out with a rifle and took shots at us.

This russian guy hopped out of the car, and with a M16 in burst fire put so many rounds into the bandit so quickly I thought he had a M249. Bandaged, got back in his car, and lead us to the base near gorka.

Turns out that that guy was Spartan using an alias, and for the next couple of weeks I operated with him looting, hoarding, looting, hoarding. Fucking about, the norm. And eventually I logged on one day and all my shit was fucked except my car.

After I got hit a few times I got on with an alias and met Spartan near Novy and I told him that someone was burning me and that shit was fucked. Spartan and I ended up using aliases and basing up west of Pobeda dam, while at the prep for another BBQ one of the guys from Juicy’s group told the moderator about how they “stole some kids stuff, and killed him five times playing it off as accidents and bandits” 

After that we weren't bothered as the server pretty much died, but after people who I had been friends with for a couple of months stabbed me in the back and felt no remorse left me with some trust issues and Spartan was the only people I could trust. We fell out of contact for about nine months until I started playing War Thunder and contacted him again. We've been playing together since.

TL:DR friends stabbed me in the back, Spartan stood with me through it all, and I know I can trust him.

This all happened around 2013 starting in September so my memory is a bit foggy about it all, but that's the gyst of it.",0

I just send my cheap ATs at the nearest enemy capital and never look back--just so my soldier gets experience. Using actual, important ATs is nothing but frustration and wasted time.

As far as I know, anything above 1080p will not support 60 FPS on YouTube's end; they will downgrade your footage to either 1080p 60 FPS, or 30 FPS.",0

"First off, only you have all the requisite information to make the right call here.  I can only give you my opinion.

That being said, it sound like she's in a fairly constant state of comfort testing.  You've demonstrated the Alpha Attraction qualities, she's seeking the Beta Comfort qualities that let her know if she can trust you.

As the first child of three, she'll probably shoulder responsibility fairly well.  This is also evidenced by her willingness and aptitude at fulfilling domestic duties.

She doesn't spend as much time as she should cultivating her own self esteem; she relies on validation from others - you, specifically - to fill this void.  This is most women, so it's not a deal breaker.  I get this from the info about her room and bathroom - the household areas that most represent her - being a mess, and the info about not taking care of her body and health.  Possessions provide part of this external validation, as well.  But materialism is a primarily feminine quality, so once again, not a deal breaker.

You've (apparently very bluntly) told her that if she doesn't get her act straight, you're out.  This is a failure of the comfort test, but can be a passing score for shit testing.  Although I'm generally against bluntly stating the truth to women - implication is your friend - it can work with some, and with her being a firstborn it's more likely to work with her.

You've really got to figure out where her head is at to know how to proceed.

I'd start building up the comfort if I were you.  Gauge her response to this.  You seem like you're being honest with yourself, so as long as you're willing to bear the pain if you build comfort - making yourself more vulnerable - and it still doesn't work out, I think this is the best course.

*edited to add*: With all this, I can't condone pursuing a monogamous LTR.  You're 25, you've got a decade before you should really be pursuing the stasis of a family dynamic.  But you know your own head, and I don't, so there it is.",0

"&gt; to the more internal talking over them and not letting them get a word in edgewise.

Exhibit A, right here. You are doing this right now.

Piece of advice for the future: when trying to understand a group of people or viewpoint that is different from your own experience, don't argue or dismiss what the group is saying. Instead, recognize your own experience as being different and LISTEN.

Seriously, this right here is why I engage so few men in these conversations, because I know it's just going to turn into a cross-examination of the female experience, or men looking for a pat on the back for not partaking in the behavior I so often see. I get that this often happens because men simply *don't see* a lot of what women experience, or *don't see* it through a female lens. When they don't understand a described situation, because they have never been in a position where said situation would be threatening, a lot men will argue or dismiss the situation as not being a real concern.

It's great that you don't think women belong in the kitchen! I wish more people didn't. But protesting ""I'm a man and I don't do that!"" isn't helping the discussion. It honestly comes across as argumentative or derailing. /u/oliviathecf is explaining her experience. Your saying, ""I don't do that!"" doesn't contradict her experience, or the experiences of many, many women. 

You are but one drop in the ocean, just like the rest of us. You sound like a good raindrop, one of many who respect women, but how many raindrops *don't?* Collectively, how big are their waves?

If you have genuine questions, ask them! 

If a women shares an experience that you haven't had, don't debate! Ask to learn more about it and try to understand her point of view.

And above all, LISTEN.",0

"I said parents are on the entitlement train, not schools.

You are trying to create an argument that parents, because they pay taxes, etc., should be able to violate the school's attendance policy. And anyone like me, who feels otherwise, is compared to Nazis.

Let me explain something to you. School policies are put into place not by administrators, but by school boards. School boards consist of elected citizens, much like the Legislative Branch of the United States government. These citizens are elected by their peers, to decide on and implement policies, with the best interests of their constituents. 

If this father, or any parent, has a problem with the policies of their elected officials, they can't simply violate those policies. They have to suck it up, and play along, with the hope that one day, they can get elected to the school board, or get one or more of their friends elected.

 I don't like having a speed limit on the highway, but the officials that have been elected in my area have deemed that to be the safest option. Paying taxes does not allow me to drive 100mph.

This attitude is commonly known as entitlement.",0

If someone were to say that they don't want dogs and referred to one of any number of the vicious dog attacks that occur every day as their reasoning, I suspect that a few of us here (myself included) would see a problem with that logic.

"&gt; The Celts were pretty savage and did their fair share of raping and pillaging before the Romans came. Does that mean that they had it coming first?

Sure. That was how things were done back then. It sucks, and it's uncivilized by modern standards, but that was what happened in that part of the world at that point in history.

&gt;Rome wasn't a democracy, it's not like the Roman civilians who were butchered decided to invade Britain.

They decided to live there as part of that empire. Let's put it this way: when you're watching a horror movie where the victims built their house on top of a Native American burial ground, do you really feel that bad for them? Or do you think ""morons built their house on a haunted graveyard, so fuck 'em""? 

Revenge isn't pretty, but it's understood by most cultures. If you didn't want to be slaughtered by Celts, you shouldn't have fucked with Celts. I feel the same way about the people who were killed in Slave revolts in the South, or in Haiti. It's a shame they died that way, but I can't really blame the people who killed them for what they did. Most people would have done the same in that position.",0

"I'd go back to your boss and tell him that you did some research and realized that you were in way over your head.

The current environment is a mess, what you are proposing is complicated and you don't really have the expertise to do it right.  If it fails, you'll take the blame and be responsible for fixing it and it doesn't sound like you are getting paid any extra.  It's a recipe for disaster and the only blame in this situation lies with your boss.

If you do go down this path, what you want is the *simplest* solution possible.  I'd forget about virtualization and just install multiple roles on one install of Server 2012.  Raid 1 is good (I'd get 4 disks and do Raid 1+0 personally). I'd go ahead and order a hard drive to serve as a hot spare.  It's not strictly necessary but it will buy you some time to replace a failed HDD and reduce the risk that you'll lose data.

You'll need to set the SQL server to back up to file and you'll need another job to clean up the old backups.  I'd use something like Acronis TrueImage to create a full backup image of your server (maybe monthly?) and keep your files sync'd to the cloud.  You'll need to make sure that the backup image somehow gets stored at an offsite location.  Storing the backups on the same server on a different disk does not protect against viruses, malicious actions or physical destruction.

A simple router should be able to handle DHCP and 5 PCs plus a server.  I don't have any recommendations, but I'd look for something that's at the high end of the consumer line.

Forget all about standardized printing - just install the printer on all 5 PCs.

Price out 5 new PCs for the office, make sure they have SSDs.  They may cost a little extra, but it's guaranteed to make everyone happy with performance.  They should probably be Windows 8.1 at this point, but make sure that any software needed for the business will run on it.  If you've got the budget, back up at least the files on those PCs as well.

Retire the other domains and get down to a single domain (you can use dcpromo to take over from the old server and retire it but honestly this is a more advanced task).  Put the new PCs in the single domain and assign permissions to the share and PCs using those accounts.

As for Office and Outlook - use Office365.  It's pretty cheap and you won't need an Exchange server.

If you've followed the above advice, you'll have a relatively simple environment that can be brought back from nearly any disaster.",0

Just posted this in another thread with the same issue. I had the same thing happen to me after I got mine pierced and my piercer told me to use Bayer Aspirin.

"This was in high school, and she was a Spanish teacher. We had a lot of class clowns in that class, and since this was Spanish 2, she knew a lot of them. There was this one such class clown (Kid A) who broke his arm and had it in a cast. One day, he had it resting on top of the desk. Another class clown (Kid B) threw a paper airplane toward Kid A's direction from the other side of the classroom. The teacher turned around and saw the airplane and got mad at Kid A for throwing it, despite the fact that it was flying towards him. Kid A, and the rest of the class, tried to defend him by saying that he didn't throw it; his arm was on the desk because he was resting it there, not because he threw it. She didn't believe any of us and thought we were all fucking with her, so she started ranting about pass incidents. She blamed us for the paperwork she lost and said she found our tests in the recycling, and that one of us must have done it. I think she got mad because we were all denying it and trying to cover for one another. So in the end she called us all little shits, and then told Kid A to leave the classroom to go to the detention room. Kid A didn't want to leave because he didn't do anything wrong, so she had to phone the school security officer to escort him out. I think she's still teaching there. I know for sure that she taught there for the entire duration I was in high school, and I only graduated high school a couple of years ago, anyway.",0

1) It is a small business run off (don't laugh too hard) Excel workbooks.  I have copies.  Customer phone numbers, purchase dates, etc. - all regular business records directly saved.  What I had that was obviously suspect or wrong I document scanned with my phone and copied with a scanner/printer.  Redundancy :)  I was a great employee for reasons like that lol.

3) I was planning on showing up early tomorrow to photograph, but now that I'm home I realize she may be planning on showing up early because she wants to put on this whole front for the sales rep.  I'm going to head back tonight to photograph and grab my phone charger.  Then everything will be out except my candy bowl and a few business cards - I cleaned out the mini fridge today and everything.

4) I never had the documentation - NBoss has a LOT of things sent directly to her other store... cuz managing the day-to-day there doesn't mean she won't also micromanage me over the phone.  Or at least try really hard to do both... in reality, nothing gets done unless I can do it or I spend three days reminding her.

As far as the IRS goes: I have form... umm... it's not in front of me but I think it's SS-8 pretty much filled out with supporting documentation (paychecks - actual paper copies cuz I e-deposited - that say ""wage + commission"" or ""salary + commisson"" and a bunch of other stuff)...

but I that form is supposed to be the one you fill out if you're not sure if you're a contractor or employee according to their website.  And I couldn't figure out if there was a different way to just straight up report her?  

She dropped the form on me two weeks before the tax deadline, and I made sure my taxes aren't overdue, and figured I'd just wait until after tax season since it was looking like I might actually have to call them?

Thank you for the reassurance.

I did not get that in writing when it originally happened.  I did tape the phone call where I confronted her about it a couple days ago, in which I mentioned that she had told me that.  She tries to evade for a bit, then says she'll evaluate it on a case by case basis, then after I say it sounds like a scam she blows up, then melts down, and finally says ""Well then they all have warranties, why is this even an issue? They all have warranties!  Can we move on already?!?""  

She called me back five minutes later to ask, ""What brought all this on?"" and says ""This is none of your business.  You won't get in trouble for this; I will.""

Fortune 500 wise the first female CEO was in 1972 for the [Washington Post](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_American_women%27s_firsts).

&gt;Shareholders like to see women CEOs

Do you have any evidence to support that?  Because I highly highly doubt that.  As shareholds only care about the stock price going up, they care less who is the CEO and care more about performance.

&gt;Well, if there were a lot more women CEOs, suddenly that rare value proposition (wow! a woman CEO!) becomes a lot less valuable (meh, she's just another CEO). If she's not as valuable to the company, they would strongly consider paying her less. IE, more women CEOS=this pay gap closes.

But if you double their pay, the DVD won't cost $40, maybe it will cost $25.

**Nose**: alcohol, rotting fruit (cherry or strawberry), some caramel hiding in behind

well that is a bit off putting...

**Palate**: alcohol, weird fruit notes - not in a good way, like rotting apples in the fall

**Finish**: lingering, all of that rotting apple *not* goodness sticking around

**60**/100

revisit with press - 1/2tsp water to 1oz

**Nose**: pears, caramel, brine, light peat

**Palate**: peat, indistinguishable fruit

**Finish**: funky ash, plum

Overall, very improved with the press! Still not a great dram, not one I would want regularly, but much better than what it was.

"Ziggs and Orianna have passives that make CSing easier. Malzahar is very easy to farm with once you buy some AP and have a few points in his E. For other AP champions, consider taking the Butcher and Arcane Blade masteries to deal more damage to minions. Other than that, it really does just come down to practicing in custom games or play norms where your goal is to *only* CS while avoiding harass and unfavorable trades. CSing in PvP will become second-nature the more you practice in PvE or a game without any distractions.

[Here](http://www.reddit.com/r/leagueoflegends/comments/204xyb/learn_to_cs_like_a_challenger_with_elyndar_a/) is a guide you should check out.

"&gt; Many people would like to have some form of social and cultural stability.

And there's nothing stopping them from doing so.  Since the society you live in is defined by the network of relationships you have with other specific people, and isn't some abstraction that exists ""out there"", all you have to do is choose with whom and on what bases to form relations with others.  If you want to reengineer the entire external world to match your preferences, though, you're SOL -- no matter how much you *want* the external world to conform to your vision of an ideal society, it will never actually be possible to bring this about.

&gt; When you reject the universal you crater into subjectivism.

But subjectivism is a correct description of reality.  Ideals and values exist only in the minds of human beings; they can be useful tools for building one's own particular life, but attempting to universalize them will create only unnecessary conflict and wholly avoidable misery.",0

"Brumbek handled himself very poorly here. He steered the conversation towards talking about harassment to the point it devolved into it being the spotlight after the hour mark. Good job on TB's part for at least trying to moderate it early on by saying this was irrelevant to the topic at hand and calling out Polygon for invoking the same method for their article's headline, but the SMIM author definitely led everyone by the nose. Very disappointed that they missed out on discussing the 25%-75% split because of this.

First, you don't get to categorize all modders as either being neutral or fully supportive of this plan. Acting as if it was only the players that were complaining about having paid mods was disingenuous and only served to help the next point.

Do not start labeling people as ""not part of the community"" because of criteria #1, #2, #3, etc. There was a lot of ""external activity"", as you call it, because this was an issue that would have far reaching ramifications on the gaming industry. As Robin brought up, the backlash was inevitable given the current climate of paid content acting as a crutch for the base game and how easily it could be exploited by publishers and development companies.

The attitude towards these peoples' opinions was disgusting, Brumbek. Calling people ""terrorists"" is a good way of alienating someone who may have been on your side to begin with. Weigh the merits of the points people bring up before knocking them down without consideration. If you let extremists color your perception of an argument, then yes, this same backlash will happen again because more and more people will become fed up having not been listened to.

There was also a lot of flip-flopping on Brumbek's part throughout the interview, mostly in regards to Valve, along with a lot of fake humbleness, though I'll just chalk it up to natural artist pride. As a modder, though, I've lost a great deal of respect for him.

Robin and TB on the other hand did decent work. Thanks for the interview guys.",0

Do you think it's possible that's the reason why Water White is such a deplorable person and as George said, 'a bigger monster than anyone in Westeros' is *because* Walt isn't pure adulterated evil? What I mean is that, in way, I look at someone like Walt as worse than a Joffrey because we know that Walt is capable of being a good person.  For someone to 'break bad' in a way, is almost more 'evil' than someone whose heart and soul are dark and evil from the get-go.  It's like, we don't expect any better from Joffrey whereas Walt has sunk to personal lows far below whatever moral lines he had set for himself prior to the show.  I hope that makes sense.  ",0

"For example the girls camps are often ""modesty"" camps where the activities are centred around socially shaming the dress and appearance of young girls, often pre-pubescent.

Little so the girls know that they won't even be able to properly see their dress once the [temple vestments](http://youtu.be/6udew9axmdM) have been placed over them.

And for the boys it's not about the wonders of creation.

"&gt;This cannot be the case. After all, one of the offerings brought by a sinner was the korban minchah, which was made up of flour.1 We also find in the Torah that both incense2 and monetary donations3 served to atone for the people.4 It should be noted that nowhere in the Torah is it stated that atonement can be found only through sacrifice, never mind blood sacrifice.5
In Temple times, an important part of atonement was normally a sacrifice brought to the Temple. But where does that leave us today, with no Temple and no possibility to sacrifice? Let us look to the Torah for a precedent.
In the book of Jonah, the people of Nineveh had sinned and G‑d was going to punish them. When Jonah showed them the error of their ways, they fasted and prayed, and were forgiven. The same thing happened in the book of Esther. Living in Persia between the first and second Temples, they fasted, regretted their sins and were forgiven. These historical examples clearly show that when there is no Temple, sincere teshuvah (repentance) is all that G‑d demands
